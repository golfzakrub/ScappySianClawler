Yet a common theme of the Yellow Submarine's run to the last four of the continent's premier competition has been the criticism directed at the 50-year-old former Arsenal boss. After knocking out Juventus in the last 16, the Italian side's manager Max Allegri was unhappy with what he perceived to be Villarreal's defensive approach, ignoring the fact the Spaniards had the majority of possession in the first leg and, with the tie delicately poised at 0-0 at half-time in the second leg, that it was Emery's team who went in search of victory. They scored three times in 45 minutes to progress. In the quarter-finals, Villarreal stunned Bayern Munich, whose manager Julian Nagelsmann also criticised Emery's tactics. Nagelsmann conveniently forgot that in the first leg, the La Liga side had missed a number of chances that could have earned them a more convincing lead. Then came the semi-final against Liverpool and the fiercest condemnation yet following a 2-0 defeat at Anfield, a scoreline they will attempt to overturn in Tuesday's second leg. One UK radio pundit described Villarreal as ""a disgrace"" to the Champions League, calling them ""pathetic"". That view was quite rightly rejected by just about everyone from both sides, with the reality being that Villarreal have a budget of just under £100m, while Liverpool's is around six times that amount. All that criticism begs the question: Does Emery get the respect he deserves? Three consecutive Europa League triumphs with Sevilla, a clean sweep of France's domestic competitions in 2017-18 at Paris St-Germain and a further Europa League success last year - Villarreal beat Manchester United in the final to win a first major trophy in their near 100-year existence - ought to have confirmed Emery's place as one of Europe's elite managers. Yet in England, his ultimately unsuccessful spell at Arsenal appears to have clouded the way he is perceived. In 2018-19, his Arsenal side had two shots at qualifying for the Champions League, but failed with both. They were pipped to fourth spot in the Premier League on the final day of the season by rivals Tottenham, then lost to Chelsea in the Europa League final. Those disappointments would ultimately define his Arsenal tenure and he was sacked within six months, but the margins were small and actually, in many ways, his first year in England had been a really positive one. His inability to speak perfect English was apparently one of the main reasons for his failings although, paradoxically, he enjoyed greater success in his first season at the club than in the second, when presumably his English would have improved. He was dismissed with the Gunners on a seven-game winless run and, of course, the reality is that had results been better Emery's English, or lack of it, would not even have been mentioned. The truth is there were a number of reasons things did not work out at Arsenal, not least the fact that young players such as Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe, who have become focal points in the team, were too inexperienced back then and required time to develop. The club were also in a transition period after more than 20 years of doing things in a particular way under the leadership of Arsene Wenger. They tried to change with a group of people put together who didn't know each other and lacked synergy. That, the lack of patience and the constant thorn in his side that was Mesut Ozil was always going to make the manager's life inordinately difficult. And, as Mikel Arteta would also find out when he arrived, many of the players were simply not as good as they or many at the club thought they were. Expectations were greater than the quality of the squad. Emery himself would admit that when things started to go wrong, he could not improve the dynamic. But he left the club a couple of steps ahead of where they were when he arrived. Emery is viewed very differently in Spain, where he is admired for his meticulous approach and tactical awareness. It is typical of him that he spent four days before the game at Anfield last week ensconced in the Villarreal Sports City complex making micro studies of the entire Liverpool side. In the process, he watched 15 of the Reds' matches in their entirety. It brings to mind the quote of Joaquin, who played under Emery at Valencia. He said of the coach: ""Emery put on so many videos I ran out of popcorn! He's obsessed with football - it's practically an illness. He's one of the best managers I've had. I worked with him for three years. I couldn't handle a fourth!"" Emery's game plans inevitably entail looking at and ticking off a check list of everything you want to achieve from a match. He knew above everything else that to try to go toe-to-toe with Liverpool at Anfield would have ended in embarrassment, although it is certainly true he wanted more from his side. He doesn't need anyone to tell him that the team needed to attack better, retain the ball for longer periods, avoid making mistakes in their build-up play, show courage with the ball, attack the spaces when available and be mentally strong when in possession. The only instruction he successfully managed on Wednesday was to prevent Liverpool opening them up with set-pieces. Everywhere else, his side was found lacking. None of those boxes were ticked at Anfield and that, coupled with Liverpool's unbelievable ability to maintain pressure high up the pitch and press with intensity for the whole game, was why Villarreal became ultra defensive. It was not because they wanted to play this way, but simply that they had no other option. They were not allowed to do or be anything else. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp himself was never going to make the mistake made by Allegri and Nagelsmann in underestimating Villarreal and he will not need reminding that, despite their superiority, they only scored twice in that game. With Gerard Moreno back in action for the home side, we could well see a different Villarreal on Tuesday. As unlikely as a dramatic Champions League semi-final comeback might be for Villarreal, victories in the past year over Juve, Bayern, Manchester United and Arsenal should serve as warning enough for Liverpool. And if Emery's side do produce something spectacular on Tuesday, it would surely be Emery's finest moment. It would underline why PSG and Arsenal appointed him - and why other leading European clubs might consider him a viable option. But any talk of a move to one of the major players in La Liga - or perhaps taking over as Spain coach when Luis Enrique's contract runs out after the World Cup - is currently way off the mark. He feels at home at Villarreal, not least because he is also enjoying the rekindling of a relationship with his son Lander, now 18. Emery is closer than ever now to his son, after missing out on his formative years because of divorce and travelling around Europe and other parts of Spain. In club president Fernando Roig, Emery has discovered a like-minded person with a very similar ethos, someone who made his future and his fortune by creating a culture based on hard work, process and progress. Along with club vice-president Jose Manuel Llaneza, they have created the perfect environment for the manager to put his plan into action, one which is not about him as a personality but fundamentally about making players better and the team more competitive. Beating Manchester United in last season's Europa League final proved to the club's fans that they were not there to make up the numbers, but a club that could compete - and win - at the very top level. The progress has satisfied Emery, which means the Premier League is not in his thoughts at the moment. He believes he still has much to accomplish at Villarreal. He was Newcastle's first choice at one stage in their search for a new manager earlier this season, but he did not want to leave behind all that he is building now. The English top flight does remain unfinished business for him, though, and he wants to test himself in Serie A too. Barcelona and Real Madrid will probably never be on his horizon, nor he on theirs, since his style and personality would not be seen as a match for either club. So for the time being, Emery is happy where he is. Right now, that is almost certainly in self-imposed exile at the club's Sports City complex, trying to discover a way of causing a major shock when Liverpool visit on Tuesday. ",positive
1,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61212449,"Man Utd 3-0 Brentford: Fernandes, Ronaldo & Varane score in morale-boosting win","Manchester United recorded the biggest win of Ralf Rangnick's reign in his final home match as interim boss as Brentford were beaten at Old Trafford. A brilliant opener from Bruno Fernandes was followed by a second-half penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane's first United goal as the hosts cruised to victory. Ronaldo also had a goal disallowed as he moved onto 18 Premier League goals, four behind Golden Boot leader Mohamed Salah. The result keeps alive United's slender hopes of Champions League qualification at least until next weekend, while Brentford could still go down, even though their 40 points is almost certainly enough to retain their status as a top-flight club. For the third game running, home fans protested against the club's owners, but while there were plenty of anti-Glazer family chants and green and gold flares in opposition to the Americans, the mooted 73rd-minute walkout did not materialise in any significant number. United's victory moved them on to 58 points with two games remaining, meaning they still have the chance to match their tally from the 2013-14 campaign under David Moyes, which is their lowest since the 59 they struggled to in 1990-91. This was actually one of their better displays, helped in no small part by Juan Mata, who was making his first league start of the season in what was probably his last match at Old Trafford. Mata could have had an assist to go with his precise passing and invention, only for Ronaldo to be judged marginally offside after he had scored from the veteran Spain international's pass. Ronaldo got his goal anyway, sending Brentford keeper David Raya the wrong way from the spot after the Portuguese had been fouled by Rico Henry. That doubled a lead given to the hosts by Fernandes. With a contract to 2026, Fernandes is one of the pillars of incoming manager Erik ten Hag's United. His first goal since February was a beauty, slamming home Anthony Elanga's cutback with a first-time volley. Raphael Varane's deflected shot brought United their third - and with the protest not gaining the anticipated momentum, there were still plenty of fans in the stadium as the home players went on their post-match lap of appreciation for a season that most connected with the club cannot wait to end. This was only Christian Eriksen's ninth match for club and country since his return from the cardiac arrest he suffered while playing for Denmark against Finland at the European Championship in June 2021. Yet the Dane has already done enough to show he can operate at a level above Brentford. Within 10 seconds of kick-off, he had lifted a pass over the United defence that threatened to create an opportunity for Bryan Mbeumo before Victor Lindelof came across to cover. It was a pin-point curling Eriksen cross that Ivan Toney headed over from a central position, a deep free-kick at the start of the second half that the striker was unable to keep on target and a long-range free-kick from the Dane that David de Gea had to palm away. Eriksen's contract runs out in the summer, although it does contain an option to extend it for a further year. The big question is whether the 30-year-old repays Brentford - and Thomas Frank's faith in offering him a way back into the game - and commits to another season or he accepts an offer from a bigger club, which will surely come his way.

2,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61212426,Fulham 7-0 Luton Town: Fulham clinch Championship title with emphatic Luton victory,"Record-breaking Aleksandar Mitrovic reached 43 goals in a season by scoring twice as Fulham clinched the Championship title in style with a 7-0 win over Luton Town. Tom Cairney scored the team's 100th goal of the campaign with a thunderous first-half strike and a thumping long-range shot from Kenny Tete doubled the tally, as Luton crumbled under injuries and Fulham's dominance. Fabio Carvalho made it three after the break, before Mitrovic scored his record-equalling 42nd goal of the campaign. Bobby Decordova-Reid and Jean-Michael Seri extended the lead, before Mitrovic tapped in his second to set a new record for English league goals in a season post-1992 and Fulham's title celebrations began. The defeat was Luton's heaviest of the season and sees them drop down a place to sixth. While a place in the play-offs is still in their hands, they need to beat Reading to ensure Middlesbrough cannot overtake them. Having confidently dominated the season, Fulham seemed to stutter towards the finish line and went into the game having won only one of their previous five matches. The Hatters started brightly and where Fulham were misfiring in the final third, Luton looked sharp with Kal Naismith forcing an early save from Marek Rodak. Yet an omen for Luton's evening seemed to come before kick-off when Nathan Jones was forced to make a late change after Allan Campbell was injured in the pre-game warm-up. The injury list grew longer when Fred Onyedinma pulled up running on the counter and he was still sitting on the ground when Harry Wilson picked out Cairney and the Fulham stalwart sent the ball rocketing into the net. Tete then made it 2-0 with an impressive strike into the corner with his weaker left foot and from that point on it was just a case of how many they would score, with the home fans began cheering every Fulham pass after the break. Wilson, whose tally for assists this season now stands at 20, flicked the ball on for Carvalho who curled it in for their third. And Mitrovic had the black and white scarves waving again when he ran into space from deep, saw his first shot blocked but tapped the rebound into the net to match Guy Whittingham's 1992-93 record of 42 goals in a season. Luton were still trying to regroup when Decordova-Reid ruthlessly made it 5-0, running between two defenders and slotting the ball beyond Matt Ingram. Ingram was drafted in by Luton in an emergency loan just 24 hours before kick-off, but having already lost to Fulham twice for parent club Hull City, he has now seen 10 goals by the London club go past him this season. Seri scored his first goal of the season with another powerful shot from distance low into the corner, before Mitrovic added a seventh in injury time to become the most prolific scorer of a single campaign in the modern era. Fulham have now scored 106 goals and are just two away from matching Manchester City, who were the last team to surpass 100 goals in English football's second tier with 108 in 2001-02. They face Sheffield United away on the final day of the season, while sixth-placed Luton now find themselves among four clubs vying for the final two play-off places - with their goal difference now inferior to Middlesbrough and Millwall, the two clubs immediately below them. Fulham first moved to the top of the table in early August and have been at the summit since 20 November, apart from one slip when Bournemouth briefly overtook them. Promotion to the Premier League is nothing new for a team that have yo-yoed between the divisions the past five seasons. But this is the first time Fulham have won a second-tier title since Jean Tigana's side did so in 2000-01. The Frenchman guided them to the top flight for the first time in 33 years in his first year at the helm. The former midfielder revolutionised the team's playing style and preparation and it produced wonders on the pitch, as they racked up 101 points. Their tally of 90 goals was well short of the 106 Fulham have now scored this season, but while the class of 2021-22 has the unstoppable Mitrovic, Tigana's team had Louis Saha, who found the net 27 times, with Barry Hayles and Luis Boa Morte contributing 18 each. Fulham wrapped up a promotion that had long seemed inevitable on 19 April, with a 3-0 win over Preston North End. Yet a draw with second-placed Bournemouth and defeat by Nottingham Forest meant the champagne was on ice when it came to them matching Tigana's champions. The demolition of Luton finally put Fulham out of Bournemouth's reach and crowned a season to remember. Fulham boss Marco Silva told BBC London 94.9: ""The aim to be champions was always inside our dressing room. We knew what we wanted from the first day. ""It started to feel in October and November that we had been so dominant, we had to finish in this way. ""To score 106 goals is an amazing achievement for us and it's fantastic to see players growing with every match. ""The record of Mitro is fantastic and it was the best way to finish this game, the second from him."" Luton manager Nathan Jones told BBC Three Counties Radio: ""It was a tough game to watch but they're the best team in the league so congratulations to them. ""We've got nine first-team injuries. What we have to do is make sure we dust ourselves off and make sure we're ready to go at the weekend. ""It all boils down to one giant, mammoth, unbelievable game (against Reading) and we'd have all taken that at the beginning of the season. ""Let's look forward to that, rather than dwell on a poor performance - they were good, but we weren't aggressive, didn't defend our box well and in the end felt a bit a sorry for ourselves.""

3,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61293998,Everton 1-0 Chelsea: 'Pickford's saves have kept their dreams alive',"With an unbroken run in England's top flight stretching back to 1954, Everton aren't about to give up their status among the elite without a fight. Their critical 1-0 win over Chelsea was a full-blooded football spectacle, with fireworks and smoke bombs playing cameo roles. But aside from Richarlison's winner, the leading star was Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford thanks to two second-half saves worthy of their own script. When England's number one somehow denied Cesar Azpilicueta and Antonio Rudiger in quick succession, Goodison Park rose in unison to cheer his efforts with a noise almost as loud as a goal. That was recognition of what was at stake, by a crowd who played a massive part in a blood-and-thunder victory, which closed the gap on Leeds and Burnley to two points. Everton started the day five points from safety as they attempted to maintain their 68-year stay in the top-flight. Some pundits have debated whether they would be the biggest club to go down from the Premier League, given their history. And, with Frank Lampard's side staring relegation in the face, it was apt that Pickford used his to deny Rudiger with a point-blank save. ""Pickford's saves have kept Everton's dreams alive,"" former Everton midfielder Leon Osman said on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""That [Azpilicueta] save was incredible. Pickford has been criticised in the past because he has a tendency to do something rash. But not today. It was arguably his best-ever game for Everton in Everton's most important game of the season. ""If Everton had lost today you would have felt they were out of the Premier League and the fans knew how important this was."" That much was emphasised by thousands of fans lining the streets in the approach to Goodison Park to welcome the team bus. Blue flares wafted down Goodison Road as supporters sang about the ""Grand Old Team"" whose Premier League status looked anything but impressive. It might have even explained the decision for some fans to create their own firework display in front of the Chelsea team hotel on Saturday night, although Thomas Tuchel said his side were unaffected by the noise despite the German boss, and midfielder Jorginho, saying it woke them up. But in a season where Everton have not won away since August, the atmosphere once again dragged the team to new heights and underlined how big a role the fans will play. Lampard said of the escort from fans: ""The feeling it gave the players, to make them understand what it means to the fans, was special. ""If it doesn't give you goosebumps, if it doesn't get you ready to go out and give everything, then you shouldn't be playing the game. ""The fans were the 12th man, they were the people of the match. The men, the women, the children that came and did that before the game, in the warm up, at the start of the game and also to get us over the line late in the game, was huge."" Seamus Coleman, who alongside Yerry Mina epitomised Everton's aggressive approach against Chelsea, added: ""I have been here a long time but never felt like I did coming into the stadium today."" Lampard said he would leave it to fans whether they replicated it for their remaining home games against Brentford and Crystal Palace. But he said it ""definitely helped"" and also highlighted how improving his side's away form would be a crucial factor in staying up, given they have trips to Leicester, Watford and Arsenal to come. Part of that may come from taking a harder approach with his players, which he admitted prior to only his fourth Premier League win in 13 games since he was appointed. That included ""prodding"" Richarlison about how he needed to be more ""clinical"" alongside his pressing, with the Brazilian rewarding Lampard with a ninth goal of the season after harrying Azpilicueta into a mistake. ""I think it was an important moment to talk [to the players] about the reality of the situation because there's different ways you can go about it,"" Lampard added. ""You can keep telling the players to believe and there are other times where we're going, 'hang on, the demands are this'. ""To be good lads and show good effort is not enough for us to stay in this league because we knew what the table said before this game. ""So my feeling was that we needed the extra bit of discipline, the extra bit of tension and, to be fair, the players have delivered that."" There is sure to be more tension as Everton try to keep their hopes alive, but Lampard said: ""My feeling is there's a long way to go in this. ""We can control our games, but we can't control Burnley or Leeds. And as much as we sit and stare at our phones and analyse their remaining games, it won't make a difference unless we do our thing."" ",positive
4,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61205840,Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 Leicester City: Son Heung-min & Harry Kane clinch victory,"Tottenham manager Antonio Conte says ""nobody could have imagined"" his team would still be in the race for Champions League qualification when he arrived in November. Son Heung-min scored twice and Harry Kane rediscovered his touch in front of goal as Spurs beat Leicester to boost their hopes of a top-four Premier League finish. Tottenham moved briefly into fourth place with the win, but neighbours Arsenal regained the spot by beating West Ham later on Sunday. ""It was vital to get three points. There was a lot of pressure but I told my players to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months,"" said Conte, who joined Spurs after they sacked Nuno Espirito Santo. ""No-one could have imagined when I arrived in November we could be in this race still, but these players are deserving to fight for such an important place. It is not easy to qualify for the Champions League in England."" England captain Kane, goalless in his previous five Spurs games, headed in the opener from Son's corner. Son stroked in the second after being picked out by Dejan Kulusevski, then curled in a sensational third for his 19th league goal of the season. Leicester's Kelechi Iheanacho scored a consolation with a crisp strike. ""It was a great, great afternoon, a great match and a great performance from the team. We totally deserved it,"" said Son, who trails Liverpool's Mohamed Salah by three goals in the race to finish as the Premier League's top scorer this season. ""Winning the Golden Boot is not important for me. Scoring goals is really good but you can't score alone. You need the team. ""If I get the chances, then I will try to score. We want to finish in the Champions League and I want to play in the Champions League."" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers made eight changes to his starting XI, with the game coming in the middle of their two-legged Europa Conference League semi-final against Roma. The Foxes remain 11th in the Premier League table, meaning winning Europe's third club competition seems their only realistic route into continental action next season. With upcoming matches against title-chasing Liverpool and top-four rivals Arsenal, Tottenham knew the importance of returning to winning ways against a Leicester side with more pressing priorities this week. Spurs had not won either their two previous matches, punished for a sluggish display in a home defeat by Brighton and unable to break down a stubborn Brentford last weekend. What was most startling about those performances, considering the amount of attacking talent at their disposal, was Spurs' inability to record a shot on target in either game. But Conte's side led at half-time at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with their only effort on target, then rediscovered their attacking verve after the break. Their trusted combination up front delivered for the first when Son clipped a corner towards the near post, where Kane had escaped his marker Daniel Amartey to power in. ""We scored early in the first half and that changed the game - we knew we'd have more space in the second half,"" said Son. The start of the second half was also tight before Son - helped by the running and guile of Kulusevski, introduced as a substitute after surprisingly being left on the bench - ensured there was no way back for Leicester. Tottenham's reinvigoration in front of goal particularly pleased Conte, who took over from former Wolves boss Nuno with Spurs eighth in the table. ""I think we were more clinical in this game. There was space for us and we exploited it very well. That was the key,"" said the ex-Chelsea, Juventus and Italy manager. While Leicester's main focus is on reaching a first European final, Foxes manager Rodgers insisted his much-changed side would not be distracted from their task at Tottenham. The visitors' rejigged line-up made a confident start. Forward Ayoze Perez forced Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris into a smart stop shortly before Patson Daka thumped the post, then a dangerous cross from Marc Albrighton needed a swift intervention from Cristian Romero with Perez waiting. But it was the old failing of defending corners which came back to damage Leicester. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel. The mentality to head the ball is missing; it's something we would need to address."" Rodgers was also left cursing Caglar Soyuncu's inability to win a loose ball against Romero, which allowed Kulusevski to set up Son for Spurs' pivotal second. ""We got the game back again and started the second half with confidence. We missed a challenge we cannot miss and they end up getting the goal from that. The challenge is in our favour, we have to win it,"" said the Leicester manager. ""The players kept fighting and the spirit was there. We kept fighting until the end. It is frustrating because of the nature of the game and there were lots of pleasing things. ""But you can't give away cheap goals.""

It was Arteta's centre-backs who came up with the goods, with Gabriel Magalhaes nodding the winner early in the second half after Rob Holding had opened the scoring from Bukayo Saka's 38th-minute corner. ""We didn't play so well,"" Arteta said. ""If I have to use a word it would be we won ugly. Big teams have to find a way to win ugly when they don't play well."" Speaking on Sky Sports, he added: ""We found a way through set pieces and defending strongly. To win here at West Ham is credit to boys and shows the spirit we have."" Jarrod Bowen did pull the Hammers level just before the break, controlling Vladimir Coufal's cross and squeezing a strike into the bottom corner in what was a reward for a strong first-half performance. But David Moyes' outfit failed to reach those levels after going behind for a second time - and defeat leaves them seventh, three points behind sixth-placed Manchester United with three games remaining. ""I thought we had done well enough,"" Moyes said. ""We conceded a couple of set pieces which we are normally very good at, both attacking and defending. We also made a few changes which left out some of the bigger players who might have been involved in those situations. ""We knew that was a risk and we got punished for it."" The Gunners are desperate to return to Europe's elite competition next season and Arteta's side have enjoyed the advantage of having no continental football this term, meaning all their resources can be focused on achieving a top-four finish for the first time since 2015-16. West Ham's only realistic chance of qualifying for the Champions League now is to win the Europa League - and Moyes' team would be forgiven for having one eye on overturning their 2-1 deficit in the semi-final second leg against Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany on Thursday. Arsenal struggled to get a foothold, though, before Eddie Nketiah's clever run and low shot forced a corner, from which Holding climbed highest to head in Saka's delivery for his first Premier League goal. Bowen's smart finish pulled the Hammers level on the brink of half-time. But, after the hosts failed to properly clear a corner, Gabriel was left unmarked at the back post to head in Gabriel Martinelli's 54th-minute cross, beating former Arsenal stopper Lukasz Fabianski at his near post. Nketiah could have sealed the success on the break, only to curl wide, but the 22-year-old continued to prove a threat after again being trusted to lead the line for Arsenal. The visitors were not at their fluent best, but as the battle with north London rivals Spurs hots up - and with the Gunners heading to Tottenham a week on Thursday - restoring their two-point advantage was the most important outcome for Arsenal. Injuries and suspensions have hit the Hammers and they found themselves without three senior centre-backs in Craig Dawson, Issa Diop and Angelo Ogbonna on Sunday, with left-back Aaron Cresswell chosen to partner Kurt Zouma. That may have been partly to blame for the hosts coming unstuck twice from set-pieces, but this was also West Ham's 52nd match of the season - 11 more than Arsenal have played - and they struggled to unpick the Gunners as the game wore on. The hosts found themselves behind despite having the better of the opening half an hour. They responded to Holding's opener within seven minutes when Bowen grabbed his 10th top-flight goal of the campaign, becoming the first Englishman to reach double figures for the club since Kevin Nolan in 2012-13. Moyes turned to Michail Antonio, rested before Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg, with 19 minutes remaining to try to find a leveller for the second time, but the forward only managed one touch in the opposition box. The Hammers have now dropped points in each of their past four Premier League matches following a Europa League fixture, while this loss brought their six-game unbeaten home run in the league to an end. More worryingly for Moyes, his side are winless in their past four Premier League outings - and the Scot will not want what has been a productive season to fizzle out now.

6,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61238706,Manchester City 4-3 Real Madrid: Classic Champions League tie a genuine gold standard match,"Carlo Ancelotti's last visit to Manchester City ended in a 5-0 humiliation in what proved to be the final match of his tenure as Everton manager. When the legendary Italian manager, 62, turned to his Real Madrid backroom staff with arms outstretched and gave an anxious glance down at his watch with City 2-0 up after only 11 minutes on his return to Etihad Stadium, he was probably fearing a similar scoreline. City were flying. Real were overwhelmed. This was shaping up as a one-sided mauling for the great old Champions League campaigner chasing the trophy for a historic fourth time. And yet, to the disbelief of pretty much everyone who witnessed a gold standard classic of a football match, Ancelotti was pitchside after the game smiling, eyebrow raised in trademark fashion suggesting he was rather happy to come away with a 4-3 first leg loss. He did not look as mystified as others at the fact that Real were still in with a shout of reaching yet another Champions League Final. City's players were not exactly deflated - how could they be after such a brilliant performance and a semi-final first leg win? However, their body language gave away the brutal fact that they should have had this tie all wrapped up heading into the second leg in the Bernabeu. This was a breathless night, everything that is good about football at this rarified level and City were, at times, magical. And yet... The Bernabeu does strange things in the Champions League and, while City are unlikely to endure the same physical onslaught Atletico Madrid subjected them to in the quarter-final second leg, they will face a severe test with just a one-goal lead. City let Real off the hook and history tells us this can be a very expensive mistake. Ancelotti, as well as many of this Real squad, have been over this course and distance before though they will also know they were ripped to shreds for long periods of this game. But they will also have serious belief they can go through to face either Liverpool or Villarreal in Paris. The good news for City is that, despite the narrow scoreline, there were times when they outclassed Real, with Luka Modric unable to exert his usual influence in midfield. City were quicker, slicker, better, more threatening. This is the knowledge they will pack with them on the flight to Madrid. And yet... Who knows what sort of lead it takes to finish Real off, backed by the Bernabeu crowd and such a rich history in this competition? Every big night in the grand old arena is accompanied by sense of destiny. A glimpse of Guardiola's mindset came with City two goals up and Real pretty much floored. The Spaniard flew into a full-on rage in his technical area when Riyad Mahrez committed the cardinal sin in this manager's book by being too greedy, lashing a shot into the side-netting with Phil Foden waiting unattended in the middle and the goal at his mercy. At 3-0 it could have been job done. ""Riyad. Riyad"", Guardiola shouted before continuing the fume. He knows you simply cannot give Real a break and the Spanish giants proved that. City had a two-goal advantage on three occasions, played wonderful, fluent football but will know there should be no need of those nagging doubts that might have been felt at the final whistle.

7,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61212449,"Man Utd 3-0 Brentford: Fernandes, Ronaldo & Varane score in morale-boosting win","Manchester United recorded the biggest win of Ralf Rangnick's reign in his final home match as interim boss as Brentford were beaten at Old Trafford. A brilliant opener from Bruno Fernandes was followed by a second-half penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane's first United goal as the hosts cruised to victory. Ronaldo also had a goal disallowed as he moved onto 18 Premier League goals, four behind Golden Boot leader Mohamed Salah. The result keeps alive United's slender hopes of Champions League qualification at least until next weekend, while Brentford could still go down, even though their 40 points is almost certainly enough to retain their status as a top-flight club. For the third game running, home fans protested against the club's owners, but while there were plenty of anti-Glazer family chants and green and gold flares in opposition to the Americans, the mooted 73rd-minute walkout did not materialise in any significant number. United's victory moved them on to 58 points with two games remaining, meaning they still have the chance to match their tally from the 2013-14 campaign under David Moyes, which is their lowest since the 59 they struggled to in 1990-91. This was actually one of their better displays, helped in no small part by Juan Mata, who was making his first league start of the season in what was probably his last match at Old Trafford. Mata could have had an assist to go with his precise passing and invention, only for Ronaldo to be judged marginally offside after he had scored from the veteran Spain international's pass. Ronaldo got his goal anyway, sending Brentford keeper David Raya the wrong way from the spot after the Portuguese had been fouled by Rico Henry. That doubled a lead given to the hosts by Fernandes. With a contract to 2026, Fernandes is one of the pillars of incoming manager Erik ten Hag's United. His first goal since February was a beauty, slamming home Anthony Elanga's cutback with a first-time volley. Raphael Varane's deflected shot brought United their third - and with the protest not gaining the anticipated momentum, there were still plenty of fans in the stadium as the home players went on their post-match lap of appreciation for a season that most connected with the club cannot wait to end. This was only Christian Eriksen's ninth match for club and country since his return from the cardiac arrest he suffered while playing for Denmark against Finland at the European Championship in June 2021. Yet the Dane has already done enough to show he can operate at a level above Brentford. Within 10 seconds of kick-off, he had lifted a pass over the United defence that threatened to create an opportunity for Bryan Mbeumo before Victor Lindelof came across to cover. It was a pin-point curling Eriksen cross that Ivan Toney headed over from a central position, a deep free-kick at the start of the second half that the striker was unable to keep on target and a long-range free-kick from the Dane that David de Gea had to palm away. Eriksen's contract runs out in the summer, although it does contain an option to extend it for a further year. The big question is whether the 30-year-old repays Brentford - and Thomas Frank's faith in offering him a way back into the game - and commits to another season or he accepts an offer from a bigger club, which will surely come his way.

8,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61300016,Villarreal v Liverpool: Does Unai Emery get respect he deserves?,"Guiding unfancied Villarreal to the Champions League semi-finals ought to have been a career highlight for Unai Emery, the manager who has taken a team from a town with a smaller population than Clacton-on-Sea to the pinnacle of European football. Yet a common theme of the Yellow Submarine's run to the last four of the continent's premier competition has been the criticism directed at the 50-year-old former Arsenal boss. After knocking out Juventus in the last 16, the Italian side's manager Max Allegri was unhappy with what he perceived to be Villarreal's defensive approach, ignoring the fact the Spaniards had the majority of possession in the first leg and, with the tie delicately poised at 0-0 at half-time in the second leg, that it was Emery's team who went in search of victory. They scored three times in 45 minutes to progress. In the quarter-finals, Villarreal stunned Bayern Munich, whose manager Julian Nagelsmann also criticised Emery's tactics. Nagelsmann conveniently forgot that in the first leg, the La Liga side had missed a number of chances that could have earned them a more convincing lead. Then came the semi-final against Liverpool and the fiercest condemnation yet following a 2-0 defeat at Anfield, a scoreline they will attempt to overturn in Tuesday's second leg. One UK radio pundit described Villarreal as ""a disgrace"" to the Champions League, calling them ""pathetic"". That view was quite rightly rejected by just about everyone from both sides, with the reality being that Villarreal have a budget of just under £100m, while Liverpool's is around six times that amount. All that criticism begs the question: Does Emery get the respect he deserves? Three consecutive Europa League triumphs with Sevilla, a clean sweep of France's domestic competitions in 2017-18 at Paris St-Germain and a further Europa League success last year - Villarreal beat Manchester United in the final to win a first major trophy in their near 100-year existence - ought to have confirmed Emery's place as one of Europe's elite managers. Yet in England, his ultimately unsuccessful spell at Arsenal appears to have clouded the way he is perceived. In 2018-19, his Arsenal side had two shots at qualifying for the Champions League, but failed with both. They were pipped to fourth spot in the Premier League on the final day of the season by rivals Tottenham, then lost to Chelsea in the Europa League final. Those disappointments would ultimately define his Arsenal tenure and he was sacked within six months, but the margins were small and actually, in many ways, his first year in England had been a really positive one. His inability to speak perfect English was apparently one of the main reasons for his failings although, paradoxically, he enjoyed greater success in his first season at the club than in the second, when presumably his English would have improved. He was dismissed with the Gunners on a seven-game winless run and, of course, the reality is that had results been better Emery's English, or lack of it, would not even have been mentioned. The truth is there were a number of reasons things did not work out at Arsenal, not least the fact that young players such as Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe, who have become focal points in the team, were too inexperienced back then and required time to develop. The club were also in a transition period after more than 20 years of doing things in a particular way under the leadership of Arsene Wenger. They tried to change with a group of people put together who didn't know each other and lacked synergy. That, the lack of patience and the constant thorn in his side that was Mesut Ozil was always going to make the manager's life inordinately difficult. And, as Mikel Arteta would also find out when he arrived, many of the players were simply not as good as they or many at the club thought they were. Expectations were greater than the quality of the squad. Emery himself would admit that when things started to go wrong, he could not improve the dynamic. But he left the club a couple of steps ahead of where they were when he arrived. Emery is viewed very differently in Spain, where he is admired for his meticulous approach and tactical awareness. It is typical of him that he spent four days before the game at Anfield last week ensconced in the Villarreal Sports City complex making micro studies of the entire Liverpool side. In the process, he watched 15 of the Reds' matches in their entirety. It brings to mind the quote of Joaquin, who played under Emery at Valencia. He said of the coach: ""Emery put on so many videos I ran out of popcorn! He's obsessed with football - it's practically an illness. He's one of the best managers I've had. I worked with him for three years. I couldn't handle a fourth!"" Emery's game plans inevitably entail looking at and ticking off a check list of everything you want to achieve from a match. He knew above everything else that to try to go toe-to-toe with Liverpool at Anfield would have ended in embarrassment, although it is certainly true he wanted more from his side. He doesn't need anyone to tell him that the team needed to attack better, retain the ball for longer periods, avoid making mistakes in their build-up play, show courage with the ball, attack the spaces when available and be mentally strong when in possession. The only instruction he successfully managed on Wednesday was to prevent Liverpool opening them up with set-pieces. Everywhere else, his side was found lacking. None of those boxes were ticked at Anfield and that, coupled with Liverpool's unbelievable ability to maintain pressure high up the pitch and press with intensity for the whole game, was why Villarreal became ultra defensive. It was not because they wanted to play this way, but simply that they had no other option. They were not allowed to do or be anything else. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp himself was never going to make the mistake made by Allegri and Nagelsmann in underestimating Villarreal and he will not need reminding that, despite their superiority, they only scored twice in that game. With Gerard Moreno back in action for the home side, we could well see a different Villarreal on Tuesday. As unlikely as a dramatic Champions League semi-final comeback might be for Villarreal, victories in the past year over Juve, Bayern, Manchester United and Arsenal should serve as warning enough for Liverpool. And if Emery's side do produce something spectacular on Tuesday, it would surely be Emery's finest moment. It would underline why PSG and Arsenal appointed him - and why other leading European clubs might consider him a viable option. But any talk of a move to one of the major players in La Liga - or perhaps taking over as Spain coach when Luis Enrique's contract runs out after the World Cup - is currently way off the mark. He feels at home at Villarreal, not least because he is also enjoying the rekindling of a relationship with his son Lander, now 18. Emery is closer than ever now to his son, after missing out on his formative years because of divorce and travelling around Europe and other parts of Spain. In club president Fernando Roig, Emery has discovered a like-minded person with a very similar ethos, someone who made his future and his fortune by creating a culture based on hard work, process and progress. Along with club vice-president Jose Manuel Llaneza, they have created the perfect environment for the manager to put his plan into action, one which is not about him as a personality but fundamentally about making players better and the team more competitive. Beating Manchester United in last season's Europa League final proved to the club's fans that they were not there to make up the numbers, but a club that could compete - and win - at the very top level. The progress has satisfied Emery, which means the Premier League is not in his thoughts at the moment. He believes he still has much to accomplish at Villarreal. He was Newcastle's first choice at one stage in their search for a new manager earlier this season, but he did not want to leave behind all that he is building now. The English top flight does remain unfinished business for him, though, and he wants to test himself in Serie A too. Barcelona and Real Madrid will probably never be on his horizon, nor he on theirs, since his style and personality would not be seen as a match for either club. So for the time being, Emery is happy where he is. Right now, that is almost certainly in self-imposed exile at the club's Sports City complex, trying to discover a way of causing a major shock when Liverpool visit on Tuesday. ",positive
9,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61086842,Bayern Munich 1-1 Villarreal (1-2 agg): Spanish side stun Bayern with late Chukwueze winner,"Samuel Chukwueze scored a late winner in the tie as Villarreal stunned Bayern Munich to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time in 16 years. Unai Emery masterminded a 1-0 first-leg win in Spain, but a dominant Bayern looked seemingly in control once Robert Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 52nd minute at the Allianz Arena. But, with just his side's second shot on target across both legs, Chukwueze levelled on the break in the 88th minute to give Villarreal the lead on aggregate - and earn them an historic victory against the six-time European champions. They will face the winner of Liverpool versus Benfica in the last four, a contest Jurgen Klopp's side currently lead 3-1 on aggregate. ""It's an extraordinary feeling, it was not easy for us,"" said Emery. ""We are moving forward step by step, we had a quarter-final, very difficult, but our goal before this game was not to give a good image of us, it was to qualify. ""To achieve something, you have to do important things and beat the favourites. That [round of 16] game against Juventus gave us a lot of confidence. ""In the semi-finals, we will try to create circumstances so that we have our chances. Liverpool are a great team and Benfica too. It will be a great semi-final to enjoy."" Former Arsenal boss Emery has pedigree in European football, winning the Europa League twice with Sevilla as well as with Villarreal last season. His side had already dumped out Juventus in the Champions League this time around, but few gave the Yellow Submarine a chance against a Bayern outfit that are nine points clear in the Bundesliga and chasing a 10th successive title. Villarreal, meanwhile, sit seventh in La Liga, but Emery has moulded them to thrive under the lights on big European nights, pulling off another defensive masterclass and ruthlessly dispatching Bayern on the break. Julian Nagelsmann sent out an uber-attacking line-up and what followed was a bombardment of pressure from the home side, albeit without creating any clear-cut chances in the first half. Flying wingers Leroy Sane and Kingsley Coman contributed to Bayern's 18 crosses before the break, but that approach became predictable and Jamal Musiala's tame header was straight at keeper Geronimo Rulli. Villarreal were not happy to simply sit on their lead, however, with Gerard Moreno proving a threat for the visitors at either end of the half, while Arnaut Danjuma, matchwinner in the first leg, fired off target. Bayern's first opportunity after the interval fell to Dayot Upamecano, who side-footed over the crossbar from Sane's cut-back, before Lewandowski took it upon himself to pull Bayern level. The 33-year-old, booked for a foul on Raul Albiol and perhaps fortunate to avoid a second caution for catching the defender again moments later, swivelled smartly from Thomas Muller's pass and squeezed a low effort into the corner off the post. It was his 13th Champions League goal of the season and Villarreal became the 30th team Lewandowski has scored against in the competition, with only Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Karim Benzema and Raul netting against as many. Muller then headed over and with every missed Bayern chance - and 45 shots mustered over the two legs - Villarreal became more confident they could snatch a goal on the break. With two minutes of normal time remaining, they did so in clinical fashion. Dani Parejo showed composure to start a move that was worked swiftly and superbly up field for Moreno to cross for Nigerian international Chukwueze to finish at the back post, just three minutes after coming on as a substitute. ""In the first leg we made the mistake of not finishing the tie and all the comments serve as motivation for us,"" said Moreno, after Villarreal reached the semi-finals for the first time since they lost to Arsenal in the 2005-06 campaign. ""They made the mistake today of not killing us off and we took advantage of that. What this team has done is great, we deserved to go through. We knew we were going to suffer in defence, but we were going to have our chances and, in the end, Chukwueze was able to make the most of it.""

10,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61233604,Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal: Jurgen Klopp's Reds take control of Champions League semi,"Liverpool took a giant stride towards another Champions League final with a commanding victory over Villarreal at Anfield. Jurgen Klopp's quadruple-chasing Reds had to demonstrate patience to break down a Villarreal side well organised by European specialist Unai Emery. Liverpool were held at bay despite creating all the chances and needed a touch of fortune to break the deadlock after 53 minutes when Jordan Henderson's cross was deflected beyond Villarreal keeper Geronimo Rulli by Pervis Estupinan. Sadio Mane increased Liverpool's control when he touched Mohamed Salah's pass beyond Rulli two minutes later. The second leg in Villarreal is still to come next Tuesday but Liverpool now look firmly on course to meet either Manchester City or Real Madrid in the final in Paris in May. Liverpool just seem to be gathering unstoppable momentum as all challenges, even from a Villarreal side that claimed the scalps of Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous rounds, are overcome. Villarreal set out to take the sting out of the home team from the first whistle, taking an age over goal-kicks and other restarts, but unlike the frustration that overtook them at times against Everton at Anfield on Sunday, Liverpool remained composed, seemingly safe in their knowledge that their chance would come. And so it proved as they moved through the gears at the start of the second half, a change of tempo that proved too much for Villarreal, with Fabinho having a goal disallowed even before Henderson's attempted cross took that crucial touch off Estupinan. Klopp was able to remove the tireless Henderson and goalscorer Mane from the fray as Liverpool remained in control. Liverpool possess such threat that it is almost impossible for a team to simply sit out and hope to keep them away, such is the array of attacking riches now at Klopp's disposal. It is a collection of such power that he was able to keep Diogo Jota on the bench until that two-goal cushion was established, such has been the stunning impact of January signing Luis Diaz. Diaz gave an electrifying performance, with two first-half shots that were simply too powerful for Rulli to hold, while his change of pace troubled Villarreal all night. Klopp and Liverpool will take nothing for granted but such is their form and confidence, it is hard to see how even a side as durable as Villarreal can haul this back. Liverpool now turn their attentions back to the Premier League pursuit of Manchester City when they travel to in-form Newcastle United on Saturday (12:30 BST). The historic quadruple is still on and the celebrations at the final whistle here suggested the Kop believes that what most observers thought was impossible is now a genuine possibility. Emery's body language and impassioned gestures in the closing moments, enraged when Villarreal players conceded possession, suggested he thinks his side are still in this Champions League semi-final despite a two-goal deficit. He has every right to hold out hope with his stellar record in these two-leg formats, having won the Europa League four times with Sevilla and Villarreal and defied the odds to take 'the Yellow Submarine' into the last four of the Champions League. It will surely require something spectacular, even for this European expert, for Villarreal to disrupt a side of Liverpool's stature. Villarreal were drilled to the last detail in defence but they were not given any opportunity to launch the devastating counter-attacks that did such damage to Juventus and Bayern Munich. Emery can never be discounted but Villarreal did not show enough here to suggest they can stop Liverpool reaching their third Champions League final under Jurgen Klopp. Player of the match ManéSadio Mané 7.87 7.82 7.69 7.61 7.43 7.43 7.39 7.37 7.34 7.27 7.01 6.98 6.97 6.86 6.85 5.60 5.40 5.36 5.23 5.04 5.02 4.96 4.94 4.94 4.89 4.83 4.39 4.28 4.27 4.24 4.20 Formation  4-3-3 Formation  4-4-2 Match ends, Liverpool 2, Villarreal 0.

11,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61212449,"Man Utd 3-0 Brentford: Fernandes, Ronaldo & Varane score in morale-boosting win","Manchester United recorded the biggest win of Ralf Rangnick's reign in his final home match as interim boss as Brentford were beaten at Old Trafford. A brilliant opener from Bruno Fernandes was followed by a second-half penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane's first United goal as the hosts cruised to victory. Ronaldo also had a goal disallowed as he moved onto 18 Premier League goals, four behind Golden Boot leader Mohamed Salah. The result keeps alive United's slender hopes of Champions League qualification at least until next weekend, while Brentford could still go down, even though their 40 points is almost certainly enough to retain their status as a top-flight club. For the third game running, home fans protested against the club's owners, but while there were plenty of anti-Glazer family chants and green and gold flares in opposition to the Americans, the mooted 73rd-minute walkout did not materialise in any significant number. United's victory moved them on to 58 points with two games remaining, meaning they still have the chance to match their tally from the 2013-14 campaign under David Moyes, which is their lowest since the 59 they struggled to in 1990-91. This was actually one of their better displays, helped in no small part by Juan Mata, who was making his first league start of the season in what was probably his last match at Old Trafford. Mata could have had an assist to go with his precise passing and invention, only for Ronaldo to be judged marginally offside after he had scored from the veteran Spain international's pass. Ronaldo got his goal anyway, sending Brentford keeper David Raya the wrong way from the spot after the Portuguese had been fouled by Rico Henry. That doubled a lead given to the hosts by Fernandes. With a contract to 2026, Fernandes is one of the pillars of incoming manager Erik ten Hag's United. His first goal since February was a beauty, slamming home Anthony Elanga's cutback with a first-time volley. Raphael Varane's deflected shot brought United their third - and with the protest not gaining the anticipated momentum, there were still plenty of fans in the stadium as the home players went on their post-match lap of appreciation for a season that most connected with the club cannot wait to end. This was only Christian Eriksen's ninth match for club and country since his return from the cardiac arrest he suffered while playing for Denmark against Finland at the European Championship in June 2021. Yet the Dane has already done enough to show he can operate at a level above Brentford. Within 10 seconds of kick-off, he had lifted a pass over the United defence that threatened to create an opportunity for Bryan Mbeumo before Victor Lindelof came across to cover. It was a pin-point curling Eriksen cross that Ivan Toney headed over from a central position, a deep free-kick at the start of the second half that the striker was unable to keep on target and a long-range free-kick from the Dane that David de Gea had to palm away. Eriksen's contract runs out in the summer, although it does contain an option to extend it for a further year. The big question is whether the 30-year-old repays Brentford - and Thomas Frank's faith in offering him a way back into the game - and commits to another season or he accepts an offer from a bigger club, which will surely come his way.

12,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60116469,Christian Eriksen: Former Tottenham midfielder joins Brentford on six-month deal,"Brentford have signed Denmark and former Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen on a six-month deal. Eriksen has not played since suffering a cardiac arrest during Denmark's match against Finland at Euro 2020 last June. He was subsequently fitted with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) - a type of pacemaker. ""We have taken an unbelievable opportunity to bring a world-class player to Brentford,"" head coach Thomas Frank said. The 29-year-old won the league title with Inter Milan last season, but the Italians and Eriksen agreed to cancel his contract in December as players fitted with an ICD cannot compete in Serie A. However, the Premier League does not have the same regulations. After leaving Inter, Eriksen started training alone at Danish side Odense Boldklub - where he was previously a youth player - and outlined his aspirations of resuming his playing career in order to play for Denmark at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. He joined Inter in 2020 following a seven-year spell at Tottenham, during which he scored 69 goals in 305 games and helped the club reach the 2019 Champions League final. Frank added: ""He hasn't trained with a team for seven months but has done a lot of work on his own. He is fit but we will need to get him match fit and I am looking forward to seeing him work with the players and staff to get back towards his highest level. ""At his best, Christian has the ability to dictate games of football. He will also bring experience of top level football to the club. I expect him to have an impact in the dressing room and at the training ground."" Speaking to Danish broadcaster DR earlier this month, Eriksen said: ""My dream is to rejoin the national team and play at Parken [Denmark's home stadium] again and prove that it was a one-timer and that it won't happen again. ""I want to prove I've moved on and that I can play for the national team again."" His agent, Martin Schoots, told the BBC: ""Playing in England again would absolutely feel like coming home for Chris and his family. ""Christian has been treated exceptionally well by the British public, not only because of his top football skills, but also because of his human values, his modesty and altruism.""

13,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61044707,Premier League: Can Fulham succeed in the top flight under Marco Silva?,"Up, down, up, down, up... will 2022-23 be the season Fulham finally avoid the drop and achieve Premier League survival? The Cottagers beat Preston North End 3-0 at Craven Cottage on Tuesday to complete one of the most foregone conclusions of the campaign and cement their return to England's top flight. But they have been here before. Twice in the past five seasons. And both times have been followed by swift, chastening relegations back to the Championship, only to once again come back up at the first time of asking. Marco Silva's team have cut through the league with ruthless efficiency - led by the unstoppable Aleksandar Mitrovic with a record-breaking 40 league goals (and counting). The Cottagers have swept away almost all before them this season. Yet Mitrovic and his team-mates have faltered when faced with the Premier League's more clinical finishers, tougher defences and all-round higher intensity. So what is different about Silva's team and do they have what it takes to finally break the relegation curse? Paul Parker, who played for the club from 1982 to 1987 before returning for a brief spell 10 years later, feels plenty will have to change if they want to avoid the drop. ""Fulham need to alter how they want to play, they play with a very slow tempo,"" he said. ""They would get ripped apart by a team like Brighton, they press and move it very quickly through the midfield - Fulham have got a long way to go. ""They're going to need to incorporate at least four players into the starting 11, I'd say."" The runaway league leaders have won 26 of their 42 games, with a Championship title now looking inevitable with four fixtures remaining and only Bournemouth able to catch them. Serbia striker Mitrovic's jaw-dropping return - smashing Ivan Toney's record of 31 goals in a single Championship season - has epitomised the front-footed intent of Silva's team. Mitrovic's 82 goals in 122 Championship matches are in stark contrast to his 24 in 104 Premier League games for Newcastle and Fulham. Parker believes Silva will need to add genuine quality to the side to get the best out of his star striker, with forward Fabio Carvalho looking destined to leave the club in the summer and impressive right-back Neco Williams' loan from Liverpool set to end. ""They need players who have played at a high level of football, in the Premier League or a top league abroad,"" said the former Manchester United right-back. ""Mitrovic needs a better calibre of player around him. When he's played in the Premier League [for Fulham] he's been in poor teams."" Parker believes Silva could take inspiration from Bruno Lage and Nuno Espirito Santo before him at Wolves, who have recruited players such as Ruben Neves, Raul Jimenez, Rui Patricio and Pedro Neto from clubs in Portugal. ""It's a physical league and so the players can deal with the physicality here,"" he added. BBC Radio London's Jamie Reid believes Fulham could make it ""third time lucky"" and stay up if they add the right reinforcements next season. ""They've got to try to strengthen in and around both penalty boxes,"" the Fulham commentator said. ""They need support for Mitrovic in the final third. He's had a wonderful season and next season is going to be harder. ""They also need to replace Fabio Carvalho, he's had a brilliant season too, it's a shame he's going to be leaving the club but Tony Khan and his recruitment team are already working on replacement options. ""They need to strengthen defensively. Neco Williams has been tremendous at right-back. ""To sign Neco on a permanent basis would be the aim and I feel the team would benefit from at least one other central defender as you need strong competition in the Premier League. ""They also need a striker and a goalscoring midfielder. They need players to be brought in to further strengthen what is a talented and motivated group."" Before leaving when Fulham were relegated at the end of last season, former boss Scott Parker said the club ""need to try to get off this rollercoaster we're on"". Here are some of the twists and turns of that crazy journey. Fulham banished the heartache of losing in the play-off semi-finals to eventual runners-up Reading in the 2016-17 season to bounce back and go all the way the following year. Slavisa Jokanovic's expansive team finished two points behind second-placed Cardiff in third - and their 79 goals were only bettered by league winners Wolves, who scored 82. Starlet Ryan Sessegnon, 17 at the time, hit 15 goals on the way to promotion, with captain Tom Cairney scoring before the Cottagers had Denis Odoi sent off on the way to beating Dean Smith's Aston Villa at Wembley. Jokanovic's time as Fulham manager came to an end in November 2018, with his side bottom of the Premier League after 12 games and without a win in nine. Leicester's title-winning hero Claudio Ranieri was brought in to change the club's fortunes, but lasted just 106 days in the job, before he was replaced by temporary boss Parker. Relegation was confirmed in a 4-1 hammering at Watford, with five games still to play. Victory in their final three games ensured they ended the season on a more respectable 26 points in 19th place, with only Huddersfield below them. Despite losing his first five games in temporary charge, Parker was given the permanent role and steered the club to a fourth-placed finish in the Championship, setting up a play-off semi-final against Cardiff. The Cottagers progressed despite losing 2-1 at home, beating the Bluebirds 2-0 in the second leg with goals from Josh Onomah and Neeskens Kebano, setting up an all-west London final against Brentford at Wembley. The final pitted the Championship's two top scorers against each other - Mitrovic and Ollie Watkins, who finished the season with 26 goals each. A tense game finished goalless before two extra-time goals from Joe Bryan sealed victory for Fulham. Five wins, 27 goals for, 53 against and a total of 28 points - two more than they had accrued in their previous top-flight season - made for grim reading as the Cottagers were relegated with three games to spare. Bobby Decordova-Reid was the club's top scorer with five goals as Mitrovic managed just three in the league, with the Serbian claiming the club ""did not deserve to stay up"" in a damning assessment of the season. Parker opted to leave the club for Championship rivals Bournemouth, with former Watford and Everton manager Silva taking over. In their 42 games, they have so far recorded 26 wins and 98 goals. Fulham have simply blown away the competition as they have stormed to the top of the league and promotion with four games to spare. The free-scoring team have hit five or more goals on six occasions, including 7-0 wins at Blackburn and Reading. They became the first English team in 88 years to score six or more goals in three consecutive games, with 6-2 wins against Bristol City and Birmingham following the 7-0 hammering of the Royals, to give them a staggering 19-goal haul. Silva will now be tasked with achieving something Jokanovic, Ranieri and Parker could not - Premier League survival. ",positive
14,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61212426,Fulham 7-0 Luton Town: Fulham clinch Championship title with emphatic Luton victory,"Record-breaking Aleksandar Mitrovic reached 43 goals in a season by scoring twice as Fulham clinched the Championship title in style with a 7-0 win over Luton Town. Tom Cairney scored the team's 100th goal of the campaign with a thunderous first-half strike and a thumping long-range shot from Kenny Tete doubled the tally, as Luton crumbled under injuries and Fulham's dominance. Fabio Carvalho made it three after the break, before Mitrovic scored his record-equalling 42nd goal of the campaign. Bobby Decordova-Reid and Jean-Michael Seri extended the lead, before Mitrovic tapped in his second to set a new record for English league goals in a season post-1992 and Fulham's title celebrations began. The defeat was Luton's heaviest of the season and sees them drop down a place to sixth. While a place in the play-offs is still in their hands, they need to beat Reading to ensure Middlesbrough cannot overtake them. Having confidently dominated the season, Fulham seemed to stutter towards the finish line and went into the game having won only one of their previous five matches. The Hatters started brightly and where Fulham were misfiring in the final third, Luton looked sharp with Kal Naismith forcing an early save from Marek Rodak. Yet an omen for Luton's evening seemed to come before kick-off when Nathan Jones was forced to make a late change after Allan Campbell was injured in the pre-game warm-up. The injury list grew longer when Fred Onyedinma pulled up running on the counter and he was still sitting on the ground when Harry Wilson picked out Cairney and the Fulham stalwart sent the ball rocketing into the net. Tete then made it 2-0 with an impressive strike into the corner with his weaker left foot and from that point on it was just a case of how many they would score, with the home fans began cheering every Fulham pass after the break. Wilson, whose tally for assists this season now stands at 20, flicked the ball on for Carvalho who curled it in for their third. And Mitrovic had the black and white scarves waving again when he ran into space from deep, saw his first shot blocked but tapped the rebound into the net to match Guy Whittingham's 1992-93 record of 42 goals in a season. Luton were still trying to regroup when Decordova-Reid ruthlessly made it 5-0, running between two defenders and slotting the ball beyond Matt Ingram. Ingram was drafted in by Luton in an emergency loan just 24 hours before kick-off, but having already lost to Fulham twice for parent club Hull City, he has now seen 10 goals by the London club go past him this season. Seri scored his first goal of the season with another powerful shot from distance low into the corner, before Mitrovic added a seventh in injury time to become the most prolific scorer of a single campaign in the modern era. Fulham have now scored 106 goals and are just two away from matching Manchester City, who were the last team to surpass 100 goals in English football's second tier with 108 in 2001-02. They face Sheffield United away on the final day of the season, while sixth-placed Luton now find themselves among four clubs vying for the final two play-off places - with their goal difference now inferior to Middlesbrough and Millwall, the two clubs immediately below them. Fulham first moved to the top of the table in early August and have been at the summit since 20 November, apart from one slip when Bournemouth briefly overtook them. Promotion to the Premier League is nothing new for a team that have yo-yoed between the divisions the past five seasons. But this is the first time Fulham have won a second-tier title since Jean Tigana's side did so in 2000-01. The Frenchman guided them to the top flight for the first time in 33 years in his first year at the helm. The former midfielder revolutionised the team's playing style and preparation and it produced wonders on the pitch, as they racked up 101 points. Their tally of 90 goals was well short of the 106 Fulham have now scored this season, but while the class of 2021-22 has the unstoppable Mitrovic, Tigana's team had Louis Saha, who found the net 27 times, with Barry Hayles and Luis Boa Morte contributing 18 each. Fulham wrapped up a promotion that had long seemed inevitable on 19 April, with a 3-0 win over Preston North End. Yet a draw with second-placed Bournemouth and defeat by Nottingham Forest meant the champagne was on ice when it came to them matching Tigana's champions. The demolition of Luton finally put Fulham out of Bournemouth's reach and crowned a season to remember. Fulham boss Marco Silva told BBC London 94.9: ""The aim to be champions was always inside our dressing room. We knew what we wanted from the first day. ""It started to feel in October and November that we had been so dominant, we had to finish in this way. ""To score 106 goals is an amazing achievement for us and it's fantastic to see players growing with every match. ""The record of Mitro is fantastic and it was the best way to finish this game, the second from him."" Luton manager Nathan Jones told BBC Three Counties Radio: ""It was a tough game to watch but they're the best team in the league so congratulations to them. ""We've got nine first-team injuries. What we have to do is make sure we dust ourselves off and make sure we're ready to go at the weekend. ""It all boils down to one giant, mammoth, unbelievable game (against Reading) and we'd have all taken that at the beginning of the season.

16,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61205840,Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 Leicester City: Son Heung-min & Harry Kane clinch victory,"Tottenham manager Antonio Conte says ""nobody could have imagined"" his team would still be in the race for Champions League qualification when he arrived in November. Son Heung-min scored twice and Harry Kane rediscovered his touch in front of goal as Spurs beat Leicester to boost their hopes of a top-four Premier League finish. Tottenham moved briefly into fourth place with the win, but neighbours Arsenal regained the spot by beating West Ham later on Sunday. ""It was vital to get three points. There was a lot of pressure but I told my players to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months,"" said Conte, who joined Spurs after they sacked Nuno Espirito Santo. ""No-one could have imagined when I arrived in November we could be in this race still, but these players are deserving to fight for such an important place. It is not easy to qualify for the Champions League in England."" England captain Kane, goalless in his previous five Spurs games, headed in the opener from Son's corner. Son stroked in the second after being picked out by Dejan Kulusevski, then curled in a sensational third for his 19th league goal of the season. Leicester's Kelechi Iheanacho scored a consolation with a crisp strike. ""It was a great, great afternoon, a great match and a great performance from the team. We totally deserved it,"" said Son, who trails Liverpool's Mohamed Salah by three goals in the race to finish as the Premier League's top scorer this season. ""Winning the Golden Boot is not important for me. Scoring goals is really good but you can't score alone. You need the team. ""If I get the chances, then I will try to score. We want to finish in the Champions League and I want to play in the Champions League."" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers made eight changes to his starting XI, with the game coming in the middle of their two-legged Europa Conference League semi-final against Roma. The Foxes remain 11th in the Premier League table, meaning winning Europe's third club competition seems their only realistic route into continental action next season. With upcoming matches against title-chasing Liverpool and top-four rivals Arsenal, Tottenham knew the importance of returning to winning ways against a Leicester side with more pressing priorities this week. Spurs had not won either their two previous matches, punished for a sluggish display in a home defeat by Brighton and unable to break down a stubborn Brentford last weekend. What was most startling about those performances, considering the amount of attacking talent at their disposal, was Spurs' inability to record a shot on target in either game. But Conte's side led at half-time at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with their only effort on target, then rediscovered their attacking verve after the break. Their trusted combination up front delivered for the first when Son clipped a corner towards the near post, where Kane had escaped his marker Daniel Amartey to power in. ""We scored early in the first half and that changed the game - we knew we'd have more space in the second half,"" said Son. The start of the second half was also tight before Son - helped by the running and guile of Kulusevski, introduced as a substitute after surprisingly being left on the bench - ensured there was no way back for Leicester. Tottenham's reinvigoration in front of goal particularly pleased Conte, who took over from former Wolves boss Nuno with Spurs eighth in the table. ""I think we were more clinical in this game. There was space for us and we exploited it very well. That was the key,"" said the ex-Chelsea, Juventus and Italy manager. While Leicester's main focus is on reaching a first European final, Foxes manager Rodgers insisted his much-changed side would not be distracted from their task at Tottenham. The visitors' rejigged line-up made a confident start. Forward Ayoze Perez forced Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris into a smart stop shortly before Patson Daka thumped the post, then a dangerous cross from Marc Albrighton needed a swift intervention from Cristian Romero with Perez waiting. But it was the old failing of defending corners which came back to damage Leicester. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel. The mentality to head the ball is missing; it's something we would need to address."" Rodgers was also left cursing Caglar Soyuncu's inability to win a loose ball against Romero, which allowed Kulusevski to set up Son for Spurs' pivotal second. ""We got the game back again and started the second half with confidence. We missed a challenge we cannot miss and they end up getting the goal from that. The challenge is in our favour, we have to win it,"" said the Leicester manager. ""The players kept fighting and the spirit was there. We kept fighting until the end. It is frustrating because of the nature of the game and there were lots of pleasing things. ""But you can't give away cheap goals.""

17,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61205838,West Ham United 1-2 Arsenal: Gunners reclaim Champions League place,"Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said it was the sign of a big team to be able to win ugly as the Gunners beat West Ham at London Stadium to reclaim fourth spot in the Premier League. The Gunners knew only a win would lift them back into the Champions League places after Tottenham beat Leicester earlier in the afternoon, but Mikel Arteta's side responded by grinding out an important three points. It was Arteta's centre-backs who came up with the goods, with Gabriel Magalhaes nodding the winner early in the second half after Rob Holding had opened the scoring from Bukayo Saka's 38th-minute corner. ""We didn't play so well,"" Arteta said. ""If I have to use a word it would be we won ugly. Big teams have to find a way to win ugly when they don't play well."" Speaking on Sky Sports, he added: ""We found a way through set pieces and defending strongly. To win here at West Ham is credit to boys and shows the spirit we have."" Jarrod Bowen did pull the Hammers level just before the break, controlling Vladimir Coufal's cross and squeezing a strike into the bottom corner in what was a reward for a strong first-half performance. But David Moyes' outfit failed to reach those levels after going behind for a second time - and defeat leaves them seventh, three points behind sixth-placed Manchester United with three games remaining. ""I thought we had done well enough,"" Moyes said. ""We conceded a couple of set pieces which we are normally very good at, both attacking and defending. We also made a few changes which left out some of the bigger players who might have been involved in those situations. ""We knew that was a risk and we got punished for it."" The Gunners are desperate to return to Europe's elite competition next season and Arteta's side have enjoyed the advantage of having no continental football this term, meaning all their resources can be focused on achieving a top-four finish for the first time since 2015-16. West Ham's only realistic chance of qualifying for the Champions League now is to win the Europa League - and Moyes' team would be forgiven for having one eye on overturning their 2-1 deficit in the semi-final second leg against Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany on Thursday. Arsenal struggled to get a foothold, though, before Eddie Nketiah's clever run and low shot forced a corner, from which Holding climbed highest to head in Saka's delivery for his first Premier League goal. Bowen's smart finish pulled the Hammers level on the brink of half-time. But, after the hosts failed to properly clear a corner, Gabriel was left unmarked at the back post to head in Gabriel Martinelli's 54th-minute cross, beating former Arsenal stopper Lukasz Fabianski at his near post. Nketiah could have sealed the success on the break, only to curl wide, but the 22-year-old continued to prove a threat after again being trusted to lead the line for Arsenal. The visitors were not at their fluent best, but as the battle with north London rivals Spurs hots up - and with the Gunners heading to Tottenham a week on Thursday - restoring their two-point advantage was the most important outcome for Arsenal. Injuries and suspensions have hit the Hammers and they found themselves without three senior centre-backs in Craig Dawson, Issa Diop and Angelo Ogbonna on Sunday, with left-back Aaron Cresswell chosen to partner Kurt Zouma. That may have been partly to blame for the hosts coming unstuck twice from set-pieces, but this was also West Ham's 52nd match of the season - 11 more than Arsenal have played - and they struggled to unpick the Gunners as the game wore on. The hosts found themselves behind despite having the better of the opening half an hour. They responded to Holding's opener within seven minutes when Bowen grabbed his 10th top-flight goal of the campaign, becoming the first Englishman to reach double figures for the club since Kevin Nolan in 2012-13. Moyes turned to Michail Antonio, rested before Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg, with 19 minutes remaining to try to find a leveller for the second time, but the forward only managed one touch in the opposition box. The Hammers have now dropped points in each of their past four Premier League matches following a Europa League fixture, while this loss brought their six-game unbeaten home run in the league to an end. More worryingly for Moyes, his side are winless in their past four Premier League outings - and the Scot will not want what has been a productive season to fizzle out now.

18,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61205839,Everton 1-0 Chelsea: Richarlison winner boosts strugglers' survival hopes,"Everton moved to within two points of the Premier League safety zone with a priceless win over Chelsea that was inspired by a thunderous atmosphere at Goodison Park. Starting the day in the relegation places, five points behind Leeds and Burnley, the hosts were lifted by their fans in their attempt to extend a 68-year stay in the top flight. Everton's aggressive pressing was eventually rewarded a minute after the break when Richarlison dispossessed Cesar Azpilicueta on the edge of the area and scored his ninth goal of the season. The Brazilian celebrated by picking up a smoke flare that had landed on to the pitch and throwing it back towards the stands. Vitalii Mykolenko could have doubled the lead soon afterwards but skewed wide, and Everton were indebted to two stunning saves from Jordan Pickford to keep themselves in front. First, the Everton keeper denied Azpilicueta after Mason Mount's shot hit both posts and spun out. From the resulting corner, Pickford then took Antonio Rudiger's shot fully in his face, needing medical treatment. It was an incredible effort from the England stopper, who also saved from Ruben Loftus-Cheek, but typified Everton's approach as they dug in to thwart Thomas Tuchel's side, even if that raw approach drew complaints from the German. Demarai Gray and Anthony Gordon could have made the game safe late on, but Frank Lampard saw his side hold out against his former employers, to earn only his fourth win in 13 Premier League games in charge. The victory was vital, reducing the gap behind Leeds and Burnley, with the Toffees having a game in hand on their relegation rivals. Chelsea, meanwhile, will rue the fact they could not turn their possession into goals, with their preparations hampered by fireworks being set off during the night outside their hotel. Tuchel said they had not affected his team, but was left to reflect on a defeat that could harm their chances of finishing third after Arsenal climbed to within three points of Chelsea by beating West Ham. If Everton and their fans were attempting to rattle their opponents, it worked, for what could prove to be a crucial step towards safety. With so much at stake, once again the supporters helped boost a struggling but spirited team to earn a third win in four home matches, which will be key to their chances of survival. Chelsea's build-up had been disrupted, with midfielder Jorginho admitting he was woken by the fireworks outside the Chelsea hotel on Saturday night. Before kick-off, thousands of Everton fans lined the streets outside Goodison Park, attempting to lift the mood that had been dampened by relegation rivals Burnley's 2-1 victory at Watford on Saturday. And in a full-blooded match, that noise helped set the tone as the hosts tore into their opponents with an aggression which was met with approval from their fans. At times, it spilled over. Fabian Delph was fortunate not to go in the book for a foul on Jorginho, and then did shortly before half-time with a late challenge on Mount. Seamus Coleman and Yerry Mina, back in the side, unsettled Azpilicueta, who was also booked after taking issue with Everton's Colombian defender. Tuchel was furious with some of the treatment handed out to his players on his first visit to Goodison Park. The football on show was limited in the first half, but it did not deter from a raucous occasion. Mount curled an effort over after eight minutes. Loftus-Cheek, who replaced N'Golo Kante in midfield, made some dangerous runs from deep, and Gordon was a lively presence, shooting wide of the near post with a left-footed effort. But no sooner had fans taken their seats for the second half, Everton went ahead and it was a goal made as a result of their tactics. Azpilicueta dawdled on the edge of the penalty box, allowing Richarlison to pinch the ball from him, receive it back from Gray and slot in at the Gwladys Street End to send the stadium into ecstasy. Three minutes later, Mykolenko hit the side netting from close range. But around the hour mark, the home fans were rewarded with more good defensive play from their team, which was cheered as strongly as if Everton had scored. Mount's initial effort somehow stayed out after he hit both posts, before Pickford produced the first of two miraculous saves, firstly to deny Azpilicueta who had the goal at his mercy. From the resulting corner, Pickford blocked Rudiger's point-blank effort to keep his goal intact. Following that commotion, and with Chelsea desperately searching for an equaliser, the game opened up, leading to further chances for Gray and Richarlison. Pickford was called into further action to deny Loftus-Cheek and Mateo Kovacic. But after seven minutes of stoppage time, the relief and delight inside Goodison was almost tangible as Lampard and his players celebrated a famous win.

19,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61062993,QPR 1-0 Derby County: Rams relegated to League One,"Derby County have been relegated from the Championship after suffering a dramatic late defeat at Queens Park Rangers. Luke Amos' 88th-minute winner for QPR, coupled with Reading's remarkable 4-4 draw against Swansea, consigned Wayne Rooney's beleaguered Rams to the drop to League One. Relegation with three games to go means Derby will play in England's third tier for the first time since 1986. Their fight for survival, in a campaign crippled by a 21-point deduction, could only have been prolonged if they equalled or bettered Reading's result. When Amos coolly slipped the ball past goalkeeper Ryan Allsop, their hopes of staying up had taken a major blow but were not over. However, Tom McIntyre's 95th-minute leveller for Reading left the Rams 10 points behind the 21st-placed Royals with three games remaining. Even then, Tom Lawrence was sent off for a second yellow card for a foul on Charlie Austin to compound Derby's misery. QPR ended a six-match winless run to move up to 10th in the table and to within two points of the top six, although sixth-placed Sheffield United could increase that gap if they beat Bristol City later on Monday. In a nervy first half of the high-stakes game in west London, Amos had an early goal ruled out for offside while Luke Plange skimmed Derby's best chance off the top off the crossbar with a header. A crucial block from Derby full-back Nathan Byrne to foil Lyndon Dykes after the half-hour mark summed up the steadfast determination Rooney's Rams have played with throughout a fraught campaign. If not for the 21-point deduction this season, for entering administration and breaching the EFL's financial regulations, Derby would be 17th in the table and almost as close to the play-off places as the relegation spots. Allsop made two crucial second-half saves, denying Ilias Chair and Dykes, but Amos finished a quick counter attack with two minutes left to break Derby's resistance and ultimately shatter what hopes they had of avoiding the drop. Derby's spirited attempt to stay in the Championship is over, but the protracted efforts to sell the club are ongoing. US businessman Chris Kirchner was confirmed as the preferred bidder to buy the club earlier this month, but while the sale continues it means Derby remain in administration - having been placed there by former owner Mel Morris 208 days ago. With just five players contracted for next season and the Rams under a transfer embargo, rebuilding the East Midlands club in League One will present significant challenges for whoever is involved. Rooney's future with the Rams is also uncertain, with the 36-year-old linked with the vacant job at Premier League side Burnley. Earlier this season he rejected an approach from boyhood club Everton to speak to them about taking charge at Goodison Park. Analysis - Ed Dawes, BBC Radio Derby's Derby County commentator The effort, energy, creativity, fighting for the cause, camaraderie. It's all been there in recent months. Those relationships have meant this team have taken it to game 43 with a 21-point deduction and that has to be commended. The amount of players that have been introduced and brought through, that's a good starting block for next season. If they can get one or two senior players to sign new contracts and play for Wayne Rooney next season, even in League One, then Derby have a fighting chance. Minus 15 points is a very strong possibility next season, but that's from the off and not in late September. Derby fans should be very proud of their team and I'm sure they are.

A first half lacking in quality saw both sides struggle to create opportunities, but the Seasiders squandered the best chance to go ahead when Gary Madine saw his penalty saved by Kelle Roos after James Husband had been felled in the area by Festy Ebosele. Both sides improved after the interval, with Kirk and Madine both going close for the hosts. But Ebiowei fired home the opening goal from inside the box after a smart cross by Ravel Morrison. Victory in front of more than 4,000 travelling fans was all but assured when the excellent Ebiowei sent in an inviting free-kick which Cashin converted past keeper Chris Maxwell. Third-from-bottom Derby's 14th win of the season capped a more encouraging week for Wayne Rooney's troubled side, with the Rams boss saying that he expects to have the club's takeover agreed in the next 10 days. Chris Kirchner was earlier this month named as the preferred bidder to buy the Rams and take them out of administration. Meanwhile, Blackpool are 16th in the table but could still climb as high as 10th with victory against Peterborough United on the final day of the season on Saturday, 7 May. Blackpool boss Neil Critchley: ""When you get a crowd like we had today, you want to give them a day to remember with some goals and a win. Unfortunately, we've not been able to do that. ""The game probably epitomised our season a bit. We were the better team in large parts, but didn't finish our chances. We conceded two really poor goals, and that was frustrating. ""Gary had his penalty saved - the goalkeeper pulled off a very good save. We've had other chances and lots of moments in the final third which we didn't finish.

21,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198200,Blackburn Rovers 0-3 Bournemouth: Solanke & Billing shine in Cherries victory,"Dominic Solanke's 30th goal of a prolific season and a double from Philip Billing kept Bournemouth on track for promotion to the Premier League and put an end to Blackburn's play-off hopes. Solanke slotted low into the corner to put the away side on their way to a win which sets up a tantalising meeting with in-form Nottingham Forest, who, following their 5-1 victory over Swansea, would go above Bournemouth with victory on Tuesday evening with just one game left to play. The Cherries were equally impressive in their win and will go into the fixture full of confidence thanks to a clinical attacking display at Ewood Park. Solanke shone throughout and teed up Billing, who fired the ball home from inside the box, and a routine victory was sealed when Billing slotted in his second from close range with just over 10 minutes remaining. Huddersfield beat Coventry 2-1 and can still mathematically sneak into the automatic promotion spots, but need to win their final game, hope Forest beat Bournemouth, both sides lose their final game, while the Terriers must also overturn a huge goal difference. Bournemouth will be sure of securing automatic promotion if they beat Forest in midweek, while two draws from their final two games will also be enough to take them back to the Premier League. The Cherries were good value for their half-time lead against a side who did not manage an attempt on target and never looked in serious danger against a Rovers side who realistically had to win to keep alive their slim play-off chances. Solanke was involved in much of the away side's most dangerous moments, finding Billing who saw his early shot blocked before the same duo combined neatly to put the Cherries ahead when Billing put Solanke through and the former Liverpool striker finished coolly. The lead should have been doubled soon after when Jaidon Anthony's fierce strike crashed back off the bar following another cute pass from Solanke. Bournemouth continued to remain on top after the break, although Ben Brereton Diaz did force keeper Mark Travers into a decent save after working his way into the box. But, after Jefferson Lerma had an effort cleared off the line and Solanke went close, the visitors did go further ahead thanks to two goals in 10 minutes from Billing to seal a result which keeps them in prime spot in a thrilling promotion race. Blackburn boss Tony Mowbray: ""It's ok running, chasing and tackling, but sometimes you play against better teams. We've already beaten Bournemouth this season, I get that, but they do have some really high-quality players. ""We had some chances and they had some chances to score. We didn't take ours and they took theirs. ""The more you try to attack to win a game, you leave yourself more vulnerable and I think that's what happened today. ""Against the quality of Bournemouth, they punished us today, but I couldn't question the desire of our team. We needed one of our chances to go in. ""Mid-February we were sitting second in the league and it's obviously frustrating we've missed out on the play-offs with a game to go. I feel as if I'm leaving them with some talent in that squad and some assets there and hopefully they can continue to grow."" Bournemouth boss Scott Parker: ""Overall, it was a day that went to plan in every aspect. ""We knew Blackburn would have to come at us. They needed a result with the position they were in. ""We needed to be solid and diligent and all that side of the game, which we showed. We also knew if it opened up, we needed to be clinical . And we were definitely that as well. ""We needed every single player one pulling in the right direction and that has certainly been the case for large parts of the season.  It was a high-pressure game. The result was key. Performance is secondary at this part of the season. But we got a result and we got a performance. We were deadly in our moments. ""I've been in football for a long time and there's only limited teams that get to a point where they have opportunities to be successful. We have that opportunity, we need to embrace that, play with a freedom. I thought we did that very well."" Formation  4-2-3-1 Formation  4-2-3-1 Match ends, Blackburn Rovers 0, Bournemouth 3.

22,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198207,Nottingham Forest 5-1 Swansea City: Sam Surridge hat-trick downs Swans,"Sam Surridge's first career hat-trick helped Nottingham Forest keep up the pressure on Bournemouth as they thumped Swansea 5-1 at a raucous City Ground. Forest remain third in the Championship, three points behind the Cherries, who they play on Tuesday. They went ahead when Cyrus Christie scored an own goal, but Michael Obafemi levelled for Swansea before the break. Surridge then scored a 21-minute hat-trick for Forest and Alex Mighten wriggled clear to add a fifth. Bournemouth's 3-0 win at Blackburn kept their three-point cushion over Forest, who visit Vitality Stadium on Tuesday. Forest's goal difference is now one better than that of the Cherries. Forest were looking to build on their superb 1-0 midweek win at champions elect Fulham, with their fans no doubt wishing boss Steve Cooper had been in charge since the start of the campaign. Since the Welshman took charge in September, Forest who have won more points - 75 - than any other Championship team over the same period. Forest almost found the early goal they sought on four minutes, but ex-Swans striker Surridge saw his effort partially blocked by goalkeeper Andy Fisher, with defender Ryan Manning blocking on the line from Philip Zinckernagel's follow-up effort. Surridge, who made 23 appearances for Swansea in the 2019-20 campaign, was looking lively and he raced clear on 11 minutes, but he could not get his angles right as he looked to lob Fisher, who saved comfortably. The contest swung in Forest's favour on 22 minutes when Jack Colback took advantage of some lax Swansea defending and looked to have put the hosts ahead, only for Christie to attempt to scoop the ball from goal with his hands as he failed to clear. Referee Graham Scott initially awarded a penalty and a red card for Christie. But technology showed the ball had crossed the line, so an own goal and a yellow card were all Christie ultimately had to show for his goalkeeping effort. Forest's lead lasted only six minutes, as Obafemi finished brilliantly after controlling Matt Grimes' clever cross, though there was almost an instant riposte as Fisher brilliantly denied Joe Worrall's header from James Garner's corner. Fisher was in fine form and made two key saves on 43 minutes to deny Surridge by tipping his header - from another Garner corner - on to the post, before stopping Ryan Yates' close-range rebound. Surridge fired wide in first-half stoppage time - he might have had a hat-trick in the first half - as the hosts were left to wonder how they had not regained the lead. However, any sense of frustration for Forest dissipated within three minutes of the restart as Surridge finally found the net as he headed home from another pinpoint Garner set-piece. Swansea supporters sometimes questioned the style of football Cooper's side played during his two years as their manager, but the hosts continued to create chance after chance and Surridge curled home his second goal on 52 minutes following a rapid Forest counter-attack. The win was secured on 69 minutes as Joel Latibeaudiere deflected a cross on to the crossbar and Surridge was on hand to hammer home the rebound. The hosts added a fifth on 84 minutes as Mighten found far too much space and kept his composure to beat Fisher and set up Forest for their showdown with Bournemouth. Nottingham Forest boss Steve Cooper told BBC Radio Wales: ""I thought we were excellent today, the game plan came off perfectly. ""We were very happy for Swansea to have the ball, we wanted to control the game without the ball, which we did brilliantly. ""5-1 is obviously a great result, but to be honest it could have been more, it should have been 5-1 at half-time. ""We know Swansea have a lot of the ball, but also knew they also concede a hell of a lot of chances and a hell of a lot of goals."" Swansea City boss Russell Martin told BBC Radio Wales: ""In the first half I thought we were really good, we had a couple of scares, but mainly from set-pieces. ""We don't have height and the power that Nottingham Forest have. ""It was the same story on Tuesday night (against Bournemouth) and it is something we need to address in the summer, for sure… it's a sign of what we're lacking. ""Today's been embarrassing, the second 45 minutes. The supporters didn't deserve that, and the players and staff didn't deserve that for the way they've worked.""

23,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/58579227,Chris Hughton: Nottingham Forest sack boss after six defeats in seven matches,"Nottingham Forest have sacked boss Chris Hughton after they suffered their sixth loss from seven Championship matches this season. Forest fell to a 2-0 home defeat by Middlesbrough on Wednesday and are bottom of the table with one point. Hughton, 62, took over at the start of last season when Sabri Lamouchi was sacked after the Reds lost their first four league games. He guided Forest to safety in 2020-21 and exits with 14 wins from 52 games. ""The club would like to place on record its appreciation for Chris' efforts,"" a club statement said. ""Chris joined the club in a difficult period for everyone in football and around the world and we thank him for the way he has conducted himself during his tenure."" Hughton is the first manager to be sacked in England's top four divisions this season, with Steven Reid taking over as interim head coach while Forest search for a new boss. Pressure grew on Hughton after they lost their first four games of the season for a second successive campaign. However, a battling draw at local rivals Derby in the final fixture before the international break saw him given more time to turn their form around. It was not to be for the former Newcastle and Brighton boss though, as they suffered a 2-1 home defeat by Cardiff on Sunday, having led, and were then well beaten by Boro on Wednesday. Reid's first game in interim charge will be at in-form Huddersfield on Saturday. BBC Radio Nottingham's Forest correspondent, Colin Fray After two more home defeats this week, there was an air of inevitability about the decision. Forest had tried to give Hughton time to turn things around, but a season littered by defensive errors, few shots on target and even fewer points, meant they had to act. Ultimately, football is about results and performances. The results speak for themselves - 12 wins in 49 league games in all, and the worst start to a season for 108 years. As for performances, Hughton's style was dubbed by many to be too negative, too defensive, too stubborn in its reluctance to change. In those 49 league games, they scored only 41 goals, conceding 50. It wasn't thrilling, it wasn't exciting, and so when results took a downturn (he leaves without a win in 13 league matches), he didn't have many backers left among the support base. There were mitigating circumstances for the likeable, calm and polite Hughton to have to deal with. He inherited a squad almost a year ago that had lost its first four games. Up until deadline day last month, he'd been able to make just one long-term permanent signing - goalkeeper Ethan Horvath. Players this summer were signed late - some still haven't arrived. He'd been in charge during the Covid no-fans period, so was unable to build a rapport with a frustrated fanbase, and talking of Covid, it hit the Forest camp in July, wrecking the last two weeks of pre-season, and leaving them under prepared. Another poor start means staying in the division has yet again become the disappointing first aim for another season. The big question for Forest now is, can they find a manager capable of getting the best out of a squad which, by the club's own admission, has been trimmed in size, made younger, and costs less than last season?

24,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47442886,Japan Women 0-3 England Women: Lionesses win SheBelieves Cup for first time,"England won the SheBelieves Cup for the first time after thrashing Japan in their final match in Tampa. Jodie Taylor set up Lucy Staniforth to fire England into an early lead with a fine low finish from outside the area. Karen Carney doubled the lead when she nodded in from Taylor's lofted cut-back before Beth Mead fired in a third before half-time. England also beat Brazil and drew with hosts the USA to ensure they topped the four-team round-robin competition. The night's other game saw the USA beat Brazil 1-0. It is the first time England have won the invitational tournament, which was introduced in 2016, having lost to world champions the USA in last year's competition. England, ranked fourth in the world, also meet Japan again in the group stages of this summer's World Cup in France, which kicks off on 7 June and is live across BBC TV, radio and online. Japan knocked England out in the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2015 but failed to impose themselves following a dominant first-half display from the Lionesses. Taylor lit up the show, using her pace to cause the defence problems and showing her class to set up Staniforth with an excellent pass on the turn. The Euro 2017 golden boot winner then lifted an inch-perfect ball into Carney to pick up a second assist within 23 minutes. But Keira Walsh's sensational diagonal ball set up the goal of the night as Mead took it in her stride before cutting into the box and firing into the back of the net. That rounded off a near-perfect opening half, with Izzy Christiansen's injury the only negative for Phil Neville's side. Japan came out of the blocks with more intensity in the second half and came close through Rikako Kobayashi and Aya Sameshima. Substitute Yuka Momiki should have scored just before the hour but she dragged her shot wide from close-range under pressure from England keeper Carly Telford. Telford was also forced to tip Kobayashi's half-volley over the bar after Hina Sugita's header bounced inches wide of the left post. Neville's substitutions disrupted rhythm after the break, but England's lead was never in any danger as Japan failed to match the clinical shooting the Lionesses displayed in the first half. England manager Phil Neville speaking to BBC Sport: ""It was a sensational performance. I wasn't that bothered before the tournament whether we won or lost, I just wanted to see an improvement and we go home knowing we are definitely in the right direction. ""We just keep listening to the USA, Japan and Brazil talk about how good we are. But we remain humble, have fun and enjoy moments like this. ""You don't get many chances to get your hands on a trophy. It is my first as a manager so I am just going to enjoy it. It's great for everybody but I think we have bigger things to aim for. We will enjoy it but tomorrow we will look forward to the April camp."" On Izzy Christiansen's injury: ""It looks bad. But she's strong. We have lost Jordan Nobbs already in the build-up. Christiansen is vital to our squad. Hopefully she will be OK."" Former England forward Sue Smith on BBC TV: ""That will send out a statement to the rest of the world. That was a fantastic, professional performance. England had to defend in the second half and they did. It was brilliant from an England perspective."" Ex-Arsenal and England international Alex Scott on BBC TV: ""In the friendly games we have been wasteful in front of goal but the goals we have scored in this tournament have been fantastic. We have been more clinical. ""Japan's defending could have been better but England have improved so I want to look at those positives. It's that winning feeling. There are so many positives to take from this tournament and you get to pick up silverware."" England defender Laura Bassett on BBC TV: ""For England to go over to the USA and win this makes a big statement and ticks a lot of boxes...

25,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48766811,Women's World Cup: Norway 0-3 England – Lionesses into semi-finals,"England reached their second consecutive Women's World Cup semi-final as they produced an excellent performance to beat Norway in Le Havre. Lucy Bronze's brilliant second-half strike capped a fine night that saw the Lionesses become the first senior England team to reach the last four at three consecutive major tournaments. Two slick team moves had given them a deserved 2-0 half-time lead, as Jill Scott and Ellen White found the net from close range either side of White hitting the post. Nikita Parris saw a late penalty, awarded for Maria Thorisdottir's foul on England captain Steph Houghton, well saved by Ingrid Hjelmseth. But that did not dampen England's jubilant mood at full-time, as they celebrated with sheer joy after moving within one win of their first major final. White's tap-in took her goals tally to five for the tournament, putting her joint leader in the race for the Golden Boot alongside the United States' Alex Morgan and Australia's Sam Kerr. Backed by thousands of delighted travelling fans, the Lionesses will now face either France or the US in the semi-finals on Tuesday in Lyon. The hosts and the holders meet in their highly anticipated last-eight tie on Friday at 20:00 BST. England's well-deserved progression also boosted their hopes of representing Great Britain at the 2020 Olympics, with the three best-finishing European teams qualifying for next summer's Tokyo Games. England's three fine goals entertained the 21,111 fans who were at Le Havre's Stade Oceane near the English Channel, including delighted former men's internationals David Beckham and Ian Wright, who witnessed a memorable performance. The Lionesses, who reached the last four at the 2015 World Cup in Canada and 2017 European Championship, arrived in France with realistic ambitions of winning a first major title and they showed their true potential on Thursday. Wins over Scotland, Argentina and Japan saw England top Group D without finding their best form, while a victory over an unruly Cameroon side followed in the last 16. The quarter-final against Norway was without doubt the Lionesses' strongest display of the finals so far. Two excellent team moves down the right gave them a deserved 2-0 half-time lead, with Scott putting England in front in the third minute after Bronze's cut-back. Lively winger Parris then clipped wide from close range and a confident White fired on to the post as England created the best chances, before the Manchester City-bound striker tucked in from Parris' unselfish square ball. Backed by their buoyant fans' band, who danced in celebration long after the full-time whistle, England deservedly lapped up the applause before their journey continues to Lyon. Norway, who won the 1995 title, were playing in their sixth World Cup quarter-final, but were well beaten by a side ranked nine places above them. Martin Sjogren's team struggled to win the ball in midfield in the early stages and, when they did get in threatening positions in the first half, Barcelona forward Caroline Graham Hansen was repeatedly thwarted by England centre-back Millie Bright. Aiming to reach the last four for the first time since 2007, Norway did create good opportunities in the second period but were denied by some last-ditch defending. Houghton did well to clear substitute Lisa-Marie Utland's effort off the line, having earlier intervened to deny Graham Hansen a seemingly certain goal just after the break. Norway had not previously conceded a first-half goal in finishing second in Group A and eliminating Australia on penalties in the last 16. But they always faced a difficult task after Scott's early strike went in off the post and they could have lost by more if it was not for Parris' second missed penalty from three attempts at these finals. Norway have been without Women's Ballon d'Or winner Ada Hegerberg because she has refused to play for the national side since 2017, having taken a stand against what she describes as a lack of respect for female players in the country. There was a confidence about England's mannerisms as they found red-hot form as a heatwave gripped large parts of France, although a coastal breeze in the port city of Le Havre helped reduce the humidity. Arguably for the first time this summer, they sent a warning to their title rivals, two of whom meet in Paris on Friday. With the form of White - who became England's all-time leading scorer at the Women's World Cup with six goals - they will pose a major threat in the semi-finals. ""We'll have to raise our game against France or the USA but we know we can match up against either one of those teams,"" said Bronze. ""We can get a rest and watch the rest of the quarter-finals now."" England boss Phil Neville: ""That was the best they have played under me. Yesterday, I knew we were going to win this game because of the look in their eyes and the 11 that didn't play were driving it. ""This is where we want to be. We paid respect to Norway but we are the third best team in the world and we have confidence in our own ability. We heard how they were going to outrun us and we stuck to our plan and passed the ball and the ball never got tired."" Norway boss Martin Sjogren: ""We lost against a team that was better than us. We had belief that we could hurt England but at this stage of the tournament, all the teams are very good. ""I'm proud of how the players have represented Norway and how they've behaved. We would have loved to stay on, but England deserved to go through."" England and Lyon midfielder Izzy Christiansen on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Norway looked knackered and we were not. We were fresh and slick and the second goal in particular, Ellen White just puts it into the back of the net without thinking about it. ""That was a performance that had been stored up and it came out tonight."" Former England player Alex Scott on BBC One: ""Lucy Bronze announced herself at the last World Cup and she has to deal with people knowing her game. She showed why she is the best right-back in the world. ""She loves a challenge, tell her 'you are the best, now you have to be the best player in the world' and she rises to that. I knew Lucy would take my place in the team and I give her a huge pat on the back for that."" Former England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""That was the most convincing performance England have put out.

26,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61205839,Everton 1-0 Chelsea: Richarlison winner boosts strugglers' survival hopes,"Everton moved to within two points of the Premier League safety zone with a priceless win over Chelsea that was inspired by a thunderous atmosphere at Goodison Park. Starting the day in the relegation places, five points behind Leeds and Burnley, the hosts were lifted by their fans in their attempt to extend a 68-year stay in the top flight. Everton's aggressive pressing was eventually rewarded a minute after the break when Richarlison dispossessed Cesar Azpilicueta on the edge of the area and scored his ninth goal of the season. The Brazilian celebrated by picking up a smoke flare that had landed on to the pitch and throwing it back towards the stands. Vitalii Mykolenko could have doubled the lead soon afterwards but skewed wide, and Everton were indebted to two stunning saves from Jordan Pickford to keep themselves in front. First, the Everton keeper denied Azpilicueta after Mason Mount's shot hit both posts and spun out. From the resulting corner, Pickford then took Antonio Rudiger's shot fully in his face, needing medical treatment. It was an incredible effort from the England stopper, who also saved from Ruben Loftus-Cheek, but typified Everton's approach as they dug in to thwart Thomas Tuchel's side, even if that raw approach drew complaints from the German. Demarai Gray and Anthony Gordon could have made the game safe late on, but Frank Lampard saw his side hold out against his former employers, to earn only his fourth win in 13 Premier League games in charge. The victory was vital, reducing the gap behind Leeds and Burnley, with the Toffees having a game in hand on their relegation rivals. Chelsea, meanwhile, will rue the fact they could not turn their possession into goals, with their preparations hampered by fireworks being set off during the night outside their hotel. Tuchel said they had not affected his team, but was left to reflect on a defeat that could harm their chances of finishing third after Arsenal climbed to within three points of Chelsea by beating West Ham. If Everton and their fans were attempting to rattle their opponents, it worked, for what could prove to be a crucial step towards safety. With so much at stake, once again the supporters helped boost a struggling but spirited team to earn a third win in four home matches, which will be key to their chances of survival. Chelsea's build-up had been disrupted, with midfielder Jorginho admitting he was woken by the fireworks outside the Chelsea hotel on Saturday night. Before kick-off, thousands of Everton fans lined the streets outside Goodison Park, attempting to lift the mood that had been dampened by relegation rivals Burnley's 2-1 victory at Watford on Saturday. And in a full-blooded match, that noise helped set the tone as the hosts tore into their opponents with an aggression which was met with approval from their fans. At times, it spilled over. Fabian Delph was fortunate not to go in the book for a foul on Jorginho, and then did shortly before half-time with a late challenge on Mount. Seamus Coleman and Yerry Mina, back in the side, unsettled Azpilicueta, who was also booked after taking issue with Everton's Colombian defender. Tuchel was furious with some of the treatment handed out to his players on his first visit to Goodison Park. The football on show was limited in the first half, but it did not deter from a raucous occasion. Mount curled an effort over after eight minutes. Loftus-Cheek, who replaced N'Golo Kante in midfield, made some dangerous runs from deep, and Gordon was a lively presence, shooting wide of the near post with a left-footed effort. But no sooner had fans taken their seats for the second half, Everton went ahead and it was a goal made as a result of their tactics. Azpilicueta dawdled on the edge of the penalty box, allowing Richarlison to pinch the ball from him, receive it back from Gray and slot in at the Gwladys Street End to send the stadium into ecstasy. Three minutes later, Mykolenko hit the side netting from close range. But around the hour mark, the home fans were rewarded with more good defensive play from their team, which was cheered as strongly as if Everton had scored. Mount's initial effort somehow stayed out after he hit both posts, before Pickford produced the first of two miraculous saves, firstly to deny Azpilicueta who had the goal at his mercy. From the resulting corner, Pickford blocked Rudiger's point-blank effort to keep his goal intact. Following that commotion, and with Chelsea desperately searching for an equaliser, the game opened up, leading to further chances for Gray and Richarlison. Pickford was called into further action to deny Loftus-Cheek and Mateo Kovacic. But after seven minutes of stoppage time, the relief and delight inside Goodison was almost tangible as Lampard and his players celebrated a famous win.

27,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61205840,Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 Leicester City: Son Heung-min & Harry Kane clinch victory,"Tottenham manager Antonio Conte says ""nobody could have imagined"" his team would still be in the race for Champions League qualification when he arrived in November. Son Heung-min scored twice and Harry Kane rediscovered his touch in front of goal as Spurs beat Leicester to boost their hopes of a top-four Premier League finish. Tottenham moved briefly into fourth place with the win, but neighbours Arsenal regained the spot by beating West Ham later on Sunday. ""It was vital to get three points. There was a lot of pressure but I told my players to enjoy this moment because we deserved it after really great work that we did in these six months,"" said Conte, who joined Spurs after they sacked Nuno Espirito Santo. ""No-one could have imagined when I arrived in November we could be in this race still, but these players are deserving to fight for such an important place. It is not easy to qualify for the Champions League in England."" England captain Kane, goalless in his previous five Spurs games, headed in the opener from Son's corner. Son stroked in the second after being picked out by Dejan Kulusevski, then curled in a sensational third for his 19th league goal of the season. Leicester's Kelechi Iheanacho scored a consolation with a crisp strike. ""It was a great, great afternoon, a great match and a great performance from the team. We totally deserved it,"" said Son, who trails Liverpool's Mohamed Salah by three goals in the race to finish as the Premier League's top scorer this season. ""Winning the Golden Boot is not important for me. Scoring goals is really good but you can't score alone. You need the team. ""If I get the chances, then I will try to score. We want to finish in the Champions League and I want to play in the Champions League."" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers made eight changes to his starting XI, with the game coming in the middle of their two-legged Europa Conference League semi-final against Roma. The Foxes remain 11th in the Premier League table, meaning winning Europe's third club competition seems their only realistic route into continental action next season. With upcoming matches against title-chasing Liverpool and top-four rivals Arsenal, Tottenham knew the importance of returning to winning ways against a Leicester side with more pressing priorities this week. Spurs had not won either their two previous matches, punished for a sluggish display in a home defeat by Brighton and unable to break down a stubborn Brentford last weekend. What was most startling about those performances, considering the amount of attacking talent at their disposal, was Spurs' inability to record a shot on target in either game. But Conte's side led at half-time at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with their only effort on target, then rediscovered their attacking verve after the break. Their trusted combination up front delivered for the first when Son clipped a corner towards the near post, where Kane had escaped his marker Daniel Amartey to power in. ""We scored early in the first half and that changed the game - we knew we'd have more space in the second half,"" said Son. The start of the second half was also tight before Son - helped by the running and guile of Kulusevski, introduced as a substitute after surprisingly being left on the bench - ensured there was no way back for Leicester. Tottenham's reinvigoration in front of goal particularly pleased Conte, who took over from former Wolves boss Nuno with Spurs eighth in the table. ""I think we were more clinical in this game. There was space for us and we exploited it very well. That was the key,"" said the ex-Chelsea, Juventus and Italy manager. While Leicester's main focus is on reaching a first European final, Foxes manager Rodgers insisted his much-changed side would not be distracted from their task at Tottenham. The visitors' rejigged line-up made a confident start. Forward Ayoze Perez forced Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris into a smart stop shortly before Patson Daka thumped the post, then a dangerous cross from Marc Albrighton needed a swift intervention from Cristian Romero with Perez waiting. But it was the old failing of defending corners which came back to damage Leicester. ""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers. ""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel. The mentality to head the ball is missing; it's something we would need to address."" Rodgers was also left cursing Caglar Soyuncu's inability to win a loose ball against Romero, which allowed Kulusevski to set up Son for Spurs' pivotal second. ""We got the game back again and started the second half with confidence. We missed a challenge we cannot miss and they end up getting the goal from that. The challenge is in our favour, we have to win it,"" said the Leicester manager. ""The players kept fighting and the spirit was there. We kept fighting until the end. It is frustrating because of the nature of the game and there were lots of pleasing things. ""But you can't give away cheap goals.""

28,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/61205838,West Ham United 1-2 Arsenal: Gunners reclaim Champions League place,"Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said it was the sign of a big team to be able to win ugly as the Gunners beat West Ham at London Stadium to reclaim fourth spot in the Premier League. The Gunners knew only a win would lift them back into the Champions League places after Tottenham beat Leicester earlier in the afternoon, but Mikel Arteta's side responded by grinding out an important three points. It was Arteta's centre-backs who came up with the goods, with Gabriel Magalhaes nodding the winner early in the second half after Rob Holding had opened the scoring from Bukayo Saka's 38th-minute corner. ""We didn't play so well,"" Arteta said. ""If I have to use a word it would be we won ugly. Big teams have to find a way to win ugly when they don't play well."" Speaking on Sky Sports, he added: ""We found a way through set pieces and defending strongly. To win here at West Ham is credit to boys and shows the spirit we have."" Jarrod Bowen did pull the Hammers level just before the break, controlling Vladimir Coufal's cross and squeezing a strike into the bottom corner in what was a reward for a strong first-half performance. But David Moyes' outfit failed to reach those levels after going behind for a second time - and defeat leaves them seventh, three points behind sixth-placed Manchester United with three games remaining. ""I thought we had done well enough,"" Moyes said. ""We conceded a couple of set pieces which we are normally very good at, both attacking and defending. We also made a few changes which left out some of the bigger players who might have been involved in those situations. ""We knew that was a risk and we got punished for it."" The Gunners are desperate to return to Europe's elite competition next season and Arteta's side have enjoyed the advantage of having no continental football this term, meaning all their resources can be focused on achieving a top-four finish for the first time since 2015-16. West Ham's only realistic chance of qualifying for the Champions League now is to win the Europa League - and Moyes' team would be forgiven for having one eye on overturning their 2-1 deficit in the semi-final second leg against Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany on Thursday. Arsenal struggled to get a foothold, though, before Eddie Nketiah's clever run and low shot forced a corner, from which Holding climbed highest to head in Saka's delivery for his first Premier League goal. Bowen's smart finish pulled the Hammers level on the brink of half-time. But, after the hosts failed to properly clear a corner, Gabriel was left unmarked at the back post to head in Gabriel Martinelli's 54th-minute cross, beating former Arsenal stopper Lukasz Fabianski at his near post. Nketiah could have sealed the success on the break, only to curl wide, but the 22-year-old continued to prove a threat after again being trusted to lead the line for Arsenal. The visitors were not at their fluent best, but as the battle with north London rivals Spurs hots up - and with the Gunners heading to Tottenham a week on Thursday - restoring their two-point advantage was the most important outcome for Arsenal. Injuries and suspensions have hit the Hammers and they found themselves without three senior centre-backs in Craig Dawson, Issa Diop and Angelo Ogbonna on Sunday, with left-back Aaron Cresswell chosen to partner Kurt Zouma. That may have been partly to blame for the hosts coming unstuck twice from set-pieces, but this was also West Ham's 52nd match of the season - 11 more than Arsenal have played - and they struggled to unpick the Gunners as the game wore on. The hosts found themselves behind despite having the better of the opening half an hour. They responded to Holding's opener within seven minutes when Bowen grabbed his 10th top-flight goal of the campaign, becoming the first Englishman to reach double figures for the club since Kevin Nolan in 2012-13. Moyes turned to Michail Antonio, rested before Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg, with 19 minutes remaining to try to find a leveller for the second time, but the forward only managed one touch in the opposition box. The Hammers have now dropped points in each of their past four Premier League matches following a Europa League fixture, while this loss brought their six-game unbeaten home run in the league to an end. More worryingly for Moyes, his side are winless in their past four Premier League outings - and the Scot will not want what has been a productive season to fizzle out now.

29,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61284264,Real Madrid 4-0 Espanyol: Real win title as Carlo Ancelotti completes 'Grand Slam',"Carlo Ancelotti became the first manager to win the league in all five of Europe's major leagues as Real Madrid beat Espanyol to win La Liga. Two goals from Rodrygo and strikes from Marco Asensio and Karim Benzema confirmed Real's 35th Spanish title. They are 17 points clear of second-placed Sevilla with four games to play. Ancelotti has also won titles in Italy's Serie A, France's Ligue 1, the Premier League in England and the German Bundesliga. Real needed only a draw to win the title, but victory was never really in doubt once Rodrygo stroked home from just inside the area. The Brazilian doubled Real's lead a minute before the break when he robbed Sergi Gomez of possession on the edge of the penalty area and fired low into the bottom corner. Asensio finished off a rapid counter-attack before Benzema - rested with Wednesday's Champions League semi-final against Manchester City in mind - came off the bench to sidefoot home from Vinicius Jr's cutback. Ancelotti was lured back for a second spell at Real last summer following the departure of Zinedine Zidane, quitting Everton after 18 months at the Premier League club. The 62-year-old won five major titles in two years at the Bernabeu between 2013 and 2015, including 'La Decima' - their 10th European Cup - but the Spanish title eluded him. His first league title as a manager was with AC Milan in 2004, the club where he won the league twice as a player in the 1980s. The Premier League with Chelsea followed in 2010, before Ancelotti lifted Ligue 1 with Paris St-Germain in 2013 and the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich in 2017. Ancelotti's season could end in more glory, although Real must overturn a 4-3 first-leg deficit against City at the Bernabeu. If they do reach the final and lift the trophy Ancelotti would become the only man to win the European Cup or Champions League four times as a manager, having also led AC Milan to the trophy in 2003 and 2007. Wales forward Gareth Bale, who will leave Real Madrid when his contract expires this summer, was absent for the team's title celebrations. In a tweet Bale said: ""So disappointed that I'm not able to be part of the celebrations this evening due to a bad back spasm but really proud of the team for winning the title.

30,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198224,Millwall 3-0 Peterborough United: Lions keep slim play-off hopes alive,"Millwall kept their slim Championship play-off hopes alive as they beat relegated Peterborough 3-0 at the Den. After a drab first half George Saville almost opened the scoring early in the second period, but Posh keeper David Cornell pulled off a great close-range save. Millwall took the lead soon after as Benik Afobe lashed in a left-footed shot before hitting the post and bar in quick succession 10 minutes later. Josh Knight turned Jed Wallace's teasing cross into his own net as Millwall doubled their lead before Saville headed home another excellent Wallace cross two minutes later. The win - a third in a five-game unbeaten run - means Gary Rowett's side are three points off sixth-placed Sheffield United and one off seventh-placed Middlesbrough. But they need to overturn a five-goal deficit in goal difference and hope the Blades lose and Boro fail to win their final games to make the last play-off place, while Posh remain second-from-bottom. The first half had an end-of-season feel to it with no chances until Posh striker Jonson Clarke-Harris missed an excellent chance from close range five minutes before the break. Sammie Szmodics' weak effort into the arms of Millwall keeper Bartosz Bialkowski five minutes later was the first effort on target for either side. Saville's chance early in the second half kicked the game into life and Jack Marriott forced a smart save from Bialkowski soon after. Afobe's goal came after Posh failed to clear Ryan Leonard's long throw and the striker was able to readjust his feet before firing home. It should have been a bigger lead after Murray Wallace hit the bar with a half-volley and, from the resulting corner after a Peterborough clearance, Saville headed against the post. But the introduction of Jed Wallace from the bench proved to be the turning point as his crosses set up both Millwall's second and third goals to take their season to the final day. Millwall manager Gary Rowett told BBC Radio London: ""I thought it was a fabulous effort, I think the only disappointment is we had so many chances second half that we really could have scored five or six goals today. ""I think the players have done so well again at home, it's another good second half home performance. ""But to be in the position that we're in once again, it's not the first time we've been in this position to take care of our own side of the business and to take it to the last game of the season, albeit a really outside chance. ""I think the players have to deserve enormous credit and enormous complements."" Peterborough United manager Grant McCann told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: ""I'm not one to ever blame officials for a result. ""We've lost the game today because of us, but I will say the decision to give them the throw-in, which is a massive strength for them, has cost us the first goal today and swung the momentum. ""Up to that point we were comfortably the better team, I think everyone could see that. ""Yes, we were lacking the end product, yes, we lacked in the final third, they changed their shape in the second half, but we had them and then the throw-in's cost us.""

31,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198621,Leeds United 0-4 Manchester City: Visitors stay above title rivals Liverpool after comfortable win,"Manchester City produced the perfect response to Premier League title rivals Liverpool by outclassing Leeds United to regain top spot. City needed the win after Liverpool had overtaken them earlier in the day with victory at Newcastle - and they produced a highly impressive display in Elland Road's hothouse that also prolonged the relegation worries for Jesse Marsch's side. The reigning Premier League champions went ahead in the 13th minute when Rodri glanced home Phil Foden's free-kick and while Leeds were spirited, they barely tested visiting keeper Ederson until the game was lost. City doubled their advantage nine minutes after the break from another set-piece, Nathan Ake pouncing from close range when Foden's corner was headed down by Ruben Dias. Foden was City's brilliant orchestrator and he was involved again when he set up the third for Gabriel Jesus with 12 minutes left, before Fernadinho added the fourth with virtually the last kick of the game. The win means City are a point ahead of Liverpool, with four games left for both teams. It is now a case of who blinks first in the title race. Liverpool put the pressure on Manchester City by going to in-form Newcastle United and winning in the lunchtime game. For the late game, manager Pep Guardiola had to consider not only the challenges posed by the traditional fearsome atmosphere inside Elland Road and a Leeds United side desperate for the points, but also this coming Wednesday's Champions League semi-final second leg against Real Madrid. Guardiola left Kevin de Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez on the bench to keep them fresh for the test of protecting a 4-3 lead in Spain. The strategy worked as City came through in relative comfort in what was always going to be a tough physical examination. City were helped by Leeds' struggles to defend those set-pieces, with Rodri glancing home the first goal with ease early on and Ake being allowed too much time to turn in the second. The pressure will be on every game for City now, with Liverpool also showing no signs of slipping up, but this was imperious from Guardiola's men, who were simply too good for a Leeds side who showed lots of commitment but lacked quality and threat. Foden was behind all of City's best work, a spectacular talent, a creator who adds a tireless work-rate and strength to his many other qualities. With their Premier League lead restored, City's pursuit of glory now moves on to the Bernabeu. Leeds have experienced something of a bounce since the sacking of the beloved Marcelo Bielsa in February, and his replacement with Marsch, but they are still in real danger of the drop. Burnley's remarkable renaissance since sacking Sean Dyche and replacing him with Mike Jackson has set nerves jangling at Elland Road - and even louder at Everton. Leeds showed their spirit was intact and the magnificent, noisy support of their followers can never be doubted as they continued to give deafening backing to their side even with the game gone. Marsch, however, needs to somehow find goals in the latest absence of main striker Patrick Bamford and the loss of the influential Stuart Dallas to what looked like a serious injury when he flew into a challenge on Jack Grealish. Dallas, under-rated outside Leeds, is the glue which helps to hold the side together and he will be a major loss. Leeds cannot allow this comprehensive defeat by a side of City's class to inflict too much damage on morale. There is no time for that and there is no shame in being beaten by such quality. They must refocus for two tough upcoming games, away to Arsenal and at home to Chelsea. Everton may have two games in hand, but have a tough run-in of their own - and Leeds have what might be five crucial extra points on the board.

32,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198620,Aston Villa 2-0 Norwich City: Canaries relegated from Premier League,"Norwich were relegated from the Premier League with defeat against Aston Villa at Villa Park. The tame loss, coupled with Burnley's dramatic comeback win at Watford, left the Canaries bottom of the table and 13 points from safety with four games to play. Their fans continued to support as a relegation that has looked on the cards for some time was confirmed. Ollie Watkins put Villa ahead in the first half, capitalising on a slip from Brandon Williams before lashing high into the net. Williams' error summed up Norwich's season, as did their lack of potency in front of goal. They created limited openings, while Villa hit the woodwork in each half. Danny Ings added a late goal in stoppage time to add to Norwich's misery. Manager Dean Smith said ""plans are already in place"" for their bid to return to the top flight. ""I think over the past four to five weeks, there's probably been an inevitability about it,"" he added. ""I'm disappointed that we got relegated today because I thought our performance was good, but unfortunately over the season, the performances have not been good enough and we've lacked the quality required in this league. ""[The players] are very down, very dejected."" The low-key win for Villa ended a five-match winless run, lifted them to 13th in the table and took them to the 40-point mark. This is the third successive time Norwich have been immediately relegated following promotion to the Premier League. The afternoon was particularly painful for Smith, given that he left Villa earlier this season. In truth, Norwich's slide back to the second tier has looked likely throughout a season when they have rarely reached the standard required of a top-flight team. Again, they were spirited and had good spells in possession, but their lack of threat in front of goal was once again laid bare, a diving stop to deny Milot Rashica from distance the only serious save Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez had to make. Norwich have the fewest shots (336), fewest shots on target (100) and lowest shot conversion rate (7%) of all Premier League sides this season. There were issues at the back too, with Villa's opener coming from a long, hopeful ball that was not cleared, even before Williams' slip. The full-back was also outmuscled by Watkins, whose finish was aided by a slight deflection. At full-time the Norwich fans applauded their side's effort and there was no outpouring of emotion. The club's joint majority shareholder Delia Smith watched from the stands and some may again question the hierarchy's resistance to spending big following promotion. But their prudency, and manager Smith's previous promotion with Villa, should leave Norwich well placed to bounce back once again. ""We will try everything to come up again,"" said Smith. ""It is a very difficult league to stay in. I spent £125m at Villa [after promotion in 2019] to keep us up. For Villa this was a much-needed boost. It all but ends any fears of an unlikely slip towards relegation themselves, their winless run having seen them drop from ninth to 15th. Manager Steven Gerrard handed a full debut to 18-year-old England Under-19 midfielder Tim Iroegbunam, who was solid in a holding role.

33,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198625,Watford 1-2 Burnley: Two late goals lift Clarets five points clear of relegation zone,"Burnley scored twice in the final seven minutes to complete a dramatic comeback that pulled them five points clear of the Premier League relegation zone and left hosts Watford on the brink of the drop. Jack Cork's diving header from Charlie Taylor's left-wing cross cancelled out James Tarkowski's early own goal, before Josh Brownhill found the bottom corner from the edge of the box to spark jubilant scenes among the travelling fans and in the away dugout at Vicarage Road. Watford had taken a deserved early lead when Juraj Kucka's fierce effort struck the crossbar before rebounding off the unfortunate Tarkowski and into the unguarded net. The Hornets carried the greater threat in the first half, Kiko Femenia striking the near post from an inswinging corner and Joao Pedro blazing over the crossbar after escaping the Clarets defence. Aaron Lennon and Ashley Barnes forced fine saves out of Ben Foster in the second half, but there was little the veteran goalkeeper could do about either of the visitors' late goals, which came in the space of three minutes and stretched Mike Jackson's unbeaten start as Clarets caretaker manager to four matches. The Hornets' 11th consecutive home defeat leaves them 12 points adrift of Burnley and Leeds with only four games remaining. Before Saturday, the only side in the top four tiers of English football to have lost more than 10 consecutive home league games were Rochdale, who suffered 14 straight defeats in Division Three North between 1931 and 1932. It was all going so well for Watford, who were full of energy in the early stages and could have added to Tarkowski's own goal. Burnley's captain had to fling himself in the way of another Kucka strike minutes after putting into his own net, before the returning Pedro blazed over. The visitors thought they had won a penalty when Dwight McNeil's heels were clipped by Moussa Sissoko. However, the Frenchman's challenge was deemed to be outside the box and McNeil struck the subsequent free-kick straight into the Hornets wall. Emmanuel Dennis forced Nick Pope into a smart save at his near post following yet another Tarkowski deflection, as Watford continued to threaten. Burnley improved after the interval, though, and a lapse in concentration early in the second half from Ismaila Sarr almost gifted Lennon an equaliser, but Foster produced a fine save low to his left to snuff out the danger. The home side had opportunities to add to their lead on the counter-attack, but a combination of poor passing and wasteful finishing set up a nervous finish as Burnley slowly turned the screw. Foster managed to tip Barnes' powerful header on to the crossbar, but the warning went unheeded as Cork's header restored parity with seven minutes remaining. Brownhill completed the turnaround three minutes later, guiding a right-footed strike into the bottom corner after Watford had failed to properly clear McNeil's free-kick. This is the first time Burnley have won three Premier League games in a row since 2019, while Jackson also becomes the first manager to stay unbeaten in his first four top-flight matches in charge of the Clarets. The last manager not to lose any of their first four league games with the club was Owen Coyle in 2007.

34,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61287385,Watford 1-2 Burnley: Mike Jackson leads Clarets five points clear of relegation zone,"Two weeks ago, the question on many people's lips was: ""What are Burnley doing?"" Sean Dyche, a manager with experience of escaping relegation, was sacked and replaced by caretaker Mike Jackson, whose last foray into management ended in the sack at Tranmere. Four games on, Jackson has pulled Burnley five points clear of the drop with a remarkable run - the best start of any Burnley manager for 31 years. The Clarets are not out of trouble yet - but Jackson's Burnley are the form team at the bottom. Remarkably, their dramatic late 2-1 win over Watford on Saturday was the first time they have won when trailing at half-time away from home in the Premier League. ""Burnley's fans stayed for 20 minutes to sing 'Super Mike Jackson',"" former Brighton striker Glenn Murray told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""He has united a football club. ""He has tweaked Burnley's identity and given the players more time on the ball. Maybe they aren't playing under such direct instruction and they feel happier for that."" Jackson's only previous first-team managerial experience was at Shrewsbury and Tranmere. At Tranmere he was sacked after just three months, having won just two of his first 10 games in League Two. But since being promoted from his role as Burnley's Under-23 coach, Jackson has guided the first team to a draw at West Ham, followed by victories over Southampton, Wolves and now Watford - making a run of five losses from six league games a distant memory. In the 48-year-old's four games, Burnley have a better rate of goals scored, expected goals, shots, touches in the opposition box, passes in the opposition half and possession than under Dyche this season - and are playing fewer long balls. ""The freedom starts to come after a win or two and you start to realise you are decent players,"" former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy said. ""Mike Jackson deserves great credit. ""It is leadership from all angles. They are all in together. It is amazing how winning does things to you."" Asked about the revival, Jackson said there had been ""no magic wand"", instead a matter of increased confidence among the Burnley players. ""I'd say you get those results, you get that more belief, a bit more feeling about yourself and the group starts to come together, they know what's at stake and obviously everything builds with that,"" he said. ""There's been no magic wand whatsoever. It's just reminding the players who they are and making sure they stick together as a group, stay honest and look after each other. That's the way we try to do it."" Midfielder Jack Cork explained the Liverpudlian's impact. ""He pulled us all together and reminded us how good we are,"" Cork said after the 2-1 victory at Watford. ""It is a massive part of this club that when things aren't going our way, we pull together - it has not just been these past few weeks. We never gave up and were probably the better team in the second half."" As it stands, Jackson has only been given the job on a ""game-by-game"" basis. But his haul of 10 points and no defeats with a relegation-threatened team must rank among the best caretaker stints in recent memory. Perhaps the most famous caretaker manager of all is Roberto di Matteo, who won the Champions League and FA Cup after taking over from Andre Villas-Boas at Chelsea in 2012. Guus Hiddink was another interim Chelsea boss to have strong success. In his first of popular two caretaker stints he won the FA Cup, having taken charge after Luis Felipe Scolari was sacked. And it may have ended badly, but who can forget Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's spell as Manchester United caretaker manager? After Jose Mourinho was sacked, the Norwegian began with a 12-game unbeaten run, winning 10, and memorably oversaw a Champions League knockout win over Paris St-Germain.

35,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198622,Newcastle 0-1 Liverpool: Naby Keita scores as Reds keep up the pressure on Man City,"Liverpool kept themselves firmly in the fight for the quadruple as they overcame a spirited Newcastle to keep up the pressure on Premier League leaders Manchester City. Jurgen Klopp made five changes at St James' Park, including leaving top scorer Mohamed Salah on the bench, after the Champions League semi-final on Wednesday. It looked like it would backfire as in-form Newcastle started strongly, pressing Liverpool high and forcing them into a couple of early mistakes. But Liverpool grew into the game and were dominating possession when Naby Keita struck in the 19th minute. The midfielder showed great composure as he dribbled across the box and past Martin Dubravka before slotting into the net. Sadio Mane should have made it 2-0 before the break when his shot on the counter was too close to Dubravka, who also made a fine save from a Diogo Jota header. The Newcastle fans, who were aggrieved that play continued in the lead-up to Liverpool's goal because Fabian Schar was down injured, thought Miguel Almiron had equalised after rounding Alisson, only for the effort was ruled out for offside. The hosts also made a lively start to the second half, although Liverpool went closest to adding a second with Mane shooting wide from close range before Jota's shot was pushed over. It was not a vintage Liverpool display, but they got the job done and they are second, one point behind Manchester City, who won at Leeds later on Saturday to reclaim top spot after a brief spell in first place for the Reds. The Liverpool line-up may have intrigued City boss Pep Guardiola, who, while focused on his own side's pursuit of a treble, will no doubt welcome any helping hand in denting his rivals' title bid. Thiago - excellent in the 2-0 Champions League semi-final win against Villarreal in midweek - was on the bench alongside Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold. It could have been seen as a big risk, but instead it emphasised the incredible strength in depth in this Liverpool squad. James Milner came in and was his dependable self, providing experience in midfield, while Joe Gomez was solid at right-back and the front three of Luis Diaz, Jota and Mane caused as many problems as any of the attacking combinations Liverpool could field. When Newcastle pressed for an equaliser in the closing stages, Liverpool were able to send on Thiago, Salah and Fabinho to see the game out. Against a side who had won their previous six home games, Liverpool fans had a right to feel apprehensive, but the Reds overcame a big hurdle that serves only to strengthen the feeling that they will end this season with multiple trophies. Only Liverpool and City boast a better record in 2022 than Newcastle and there was understandably a buoyant mood among the home fans before kick-off. The match provided Newcastle with an opportunity to show what sort of threat they pose to teams at the top end of the table - and they certainly gave a good account of themselves. They started superbly, getting at Liverpool from the outset and making their opponents nervous. Although Newcastle could not maintain their high-tempo start, there was still a sense of pride at St James' Park at the fight shown against one of the best sides in Europe.

36,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198355,Shrewsbury Town 0-3 Wigan Athletic: Latics promoted as League One champions,"Will Keane scored twice as Wigan Athletic secured promotion to the Championship and the League One title with a clinical victory over Shrewsbury. The Latics only had to draw to be sure of returning to the second tier, but needed three points to be certain of going up as champions. An anxious final day was in prospect having wasted two previous chances to seal promotion. However, Max Power's tap-in just before the break settled the nerves and Keane's penalty and calm finish wrapped up victory for a side who were just a point away from relegation last season. Wigan's return to the second tier of English football comes two years after they dropped out of the Championship following a points penalty for going into administration. Rotherham's win over Gillingham took the Millers up as runners up, while MK Dons had to settle for third spot and a play-off place despite a 5-0 thrashing of Plymouth Argyle, who missed out on the top six. Ultimately, other results did not matter for Latics boss Leam Richardson, whose side showed urgency and attacking intent from the off, with Kell Watts heading over after a well-worked short corner and Power's 30-yard free-kick forcing Shrews keeper Marko Marosi into a fine save. The pressure told when the ball fell kindly for Power to score the opener from close range two minutes before the interval and the same player was involved in the second goal when his shot from outside box was handled by a diving Tom Flanagan. Keane knocked in the spot-kick and grabbed his second of the afternoon when he got on the end of James McClean's free-kick. To understand what it means to win promotion back to the Championship, it is important to know what Wigan have been through in less than two years. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, few considered them at risk of imminent financial instability. In July 2020, however, they entered administration when their Hong Kong owners conceded they could not support them financially, throwing an already chaotic season into further disarray. With a 12-point deduction looming, the Latics had six games left to build a cushion on the relegation places to avoid the drop to League One. Under former boss Paul Cook they put up quite the fight, including beating Hull City 8-0 to equal the biggest victory in Championship history, losing just once in their final 15 games, but their spirited efforts were not enough. A failed appeal against the points deduction followed, as did a fan-led crowdfunding campaign to save the club - leading to more than £600,000 being raised. Cook - and many of the club's squad - left the Latics just before they tentatively began the 2020-21 League One season. In March 2021, Bahraini businessman Abdulrahman Al-Jasmi bought the club after an ill-fated deal with a Spanish consortium collapsed, ending nearly a year of financial uncertainty, and the club later avoided relegation to League Two by just a point. This season, under Richardson's stewardship, the club has reached the FA Cup fourth round - as well as the semi-final of the Papa John's Trophy - as the turnaround began. Just one defeat in their final 13 games saw Richardson claw them over the line to restore their place in English football's second tier. Bill Rice - Sports Editor, BBC Radio Manchester It's only just over a year since Wigan Athletic's future was secured with a takeover bringing the club out of administration, so to earn promotion back to the Championship as champions is a phenomenal achievement. The consortium led by Abdulrahman Al-Jasmi has delivered on their promises, providing boss Leam Richardson with the tools to build a promotion-winning squad, and he has done just that, even overcoming the loss of striker Charlie Wyke, who suffered a cardiac arrest in November that ended his season. Becoming a stable Championship club was the aim from day one and they are halfway there. This Wigan might not be as swashbuckling or pretty on the eye as sides of years gone by, but they are efficient, dangerous and manage games as well as anyone - and have performers right across the pitch to call upon when required. The goalkeeper and defence have been solid and stable, the midfield pairing of Tom Naylor and Max Power have won battles all season long, and - in forwards like Will Keane and Callum Lang - the Latics have match-winners when required.

37,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198302,Gillingham 0-2 Rotherham United: Millers seal promotion with win that relegates Gills,"Rotherham United sealed promotion to the Championship and consigned Gillingham to relegation to League Two with victory at the Priestfield Stadium. It is the fourth time in nine seasons that the Millers have been promoted to the Championship, having yo-yoed between League One and the second division. Rarmani Edmonds-Green's poked first-half finish and a late second from substitute Georgie Kelly, on his debut, in the tense and high-stakes final-day meeting was enough to once again send the Millers up. Ben Thompson hit the underside of the bar for Gillingham just before the break, but that is as close as they came from taking something from a game that ended their nine-season stay in League One. Edmonds-Green, who threatened early, put Paul Warne's Millers on track for promotion with his close-range finish on 34 minutes. Gillingham goalkeeper Aaron Chapman ensured Rotherham could not relax in pursuit of promotion in a game they had to win, brilliantly denying Ben Wiles from close range just before the hour. Wiles was again denied late on before Kelly, a January arrival from Bohemians, sealed victory with a clinical 89th-minute strike. Rotherham have once again been promoted back to the Championship at the first time of asking. The Millers have now been promoted to or relegated from the second tier in each of the past six seasons, becoming the second club to bounce between two divisions for six consecutive seasons since Wimbledon did so, between the third and fourth tiers, between 1978 and 1984. Warne's side suffered heartbreak as they went down on the final day of the 2020-21 campaign despite drawing with Cardiff. They made an indifferent start to the season, with just three wins from their first seven league matches, but then embarked on a run that saw them go unbeaten in all competitions between 11 September and 26 December. A run of one league win in seven matches from the start of March, that included a first home defeat since September, saw them drop down to third behind Wigan and MK Dons. However, three wins from their final five matches proved to be enough to get them over the line. Promotion ultimately caps a fine season for the South Yorkshire side, who claimed silverware in April, amid their poor league form, when they won the Papa Johns Trophy at Wembley against League Two side Sutton. This is Warne's third promotion in his five-and-a-half-years in charge of the club and, prior to Saturday's game at Gillingham, he acknowledged that going up this season would top the previous two. ""I want the players to have that moment in time that will keep them connected forever. If we can go up automatically it will be the greatest achievement I have ever had, given the quality in this league,"" he told BBC Radio Sheffield. Attention will now turn to seeing if they can put together a squad capable of staying in the Championship, having failed to do so in each of their past three attempts. It's been a difficult season for Gillingham, who have been among the strugglers throughout the campaign, winning only three league games by the end of January. Boss Steve Evans had already been linked with the job at Stevenage before he left the Gills early in the new year following a run of 13 matches without a win in all competitions. He was replaced by former Millwall and Cardiff manager Neil Harris on 31 January and his arrival coincided with an upturn in form, with Gillingham winning five and drawing three of his first 12 games in charge to climb four points clear of the relegation zone. However, they were unable to maintain that momentum as they failed to win any of their final six games to drop into the fourth tier for the first time since 2013.

38,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198301,AFC Wimbledon 3-4 Accrington Stanley: Dons relegated after defeat,"AFC Wimbledon's relegation to League Two was confirmed after they lost a seven-goal thriller at home to mid-table Accrington Stanley. The Dons started the day in 22nd, three points behind 20th-placed Fleetwood with a goal difference seven worse than their relegation rivals - meaning a fair swing was required to overhaul them. First-half goals from Jay Rich-Baghuelou, Colby Bishop and Michael Nottingham ended any slim hopes of a miraculous final-day escape for the hosts, though they did restore some pride through efforts from Ayoub Assal and Jack Rudoni. Accrington made it 4-2 thanks to John O'Sullivan, with Rudoni's second not nearly enough to save Mark Bowen's side from the drop. It means Wimbledon end the season winless in 27 league games, the longest run by a side within a single season in England's top four tiers since Derby's run of 32 in the 2007-08 Premier League campaign. Though Fleetwood were beaten 4-2 at Bolton, the Dons would still have had to win by five goals to stay up. Victory for John Coleman's Accrington, meanwhile, saw them finish 12th and secure a top-half finish. It is the first time that Wimbledon have been relegated since they were formed by fans of Wimbledon FC in 2002. They have struggled to get out of the bottom six all season and also found goals hard to come by, having won just six of their 46 league games. Former Wales international Bowen was only appointed manager on 30 March, after the club parted company with Mark Robinson. He has been unable to steer them to a win in his seven games in charge, including a 3-1 defeat by already-relegated Crewe earlier in April. But a winless league run stretching back to early December has ultimately cost the Dons their League One status. Having been formed from the aftermath of Wimbledon's move to Milton Keynes in 2003, AFC Wimbledon won six promotions from the ninth-tier Combined Counties League up to League One in the space of just 14 years. The club also finally relocated to their former home in Merton in November 2020, as their redeveloped Plough Lane ground was completed. But after finishing 19th and 20th twice in the past three seasons, surviving by a combined seven points in that time, staying up has proved beyond them this season.

Rovers were 23rd in the table coming into their final game, three points from safety but with a substantially worse goal difference than their relegation rivals - meaning they were already realistically down. Billy Bodin put the U's ahead with a rebound from close range, with the visitors levelling through Josh Martin midway through the second half. Gary McSheffrey's Doncaster end the season 22nd on 38 points - only once have they recorded fewer points in the third tier of a Football League season - in 1987-88 when they earned 33 points. Oxford, meanwhile, finish eighth in League One, having seen their play-off bid end in recent weeks. Doncaster started the season badly with four points from their first nine league games, including a 6-0 drubbing at Ipswich, leaving them rock-bottom in League One. That improved slightly to an overall 13 points from 19 league games in December but, with Rovers still six points from safety, the club sacked Richie Wellens as manager after only six months in charge. McSheffrey was promoted from leading Rovers' under-18s side and guided the first team to some spirited results, including wins at play-off chasing sides MK Dons and Sunderland, which kept them in contention to stay up. Doncaster at least lifted themselves off the bottom of the table - helped by Crewe's dreadful run of 15 defeats in 16 games - before they ultimately relegated the Alex by beating them three weeks before their own drop was ultimately sealed. Rovers, who last went down - also from League One - in 2016, beat Burton 2-0 last Saturday, giving them a small source of hope, but with just 10 league wins all season relegation was ultimately out of their hands. This season is the first since 2003-04 in which they have played without talismanic former midfielder James Coppinger following the 41-year-old's retirement in May 2021, after a club record of 695 games in all competitions.

40,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61075987,Fulham 3-0 Preston North End: Whites clinch Premier League return,"Fulham crushed Preston to seal their Premier League return as Aleksandar Mitrovic's double took his season's tally to 40 goals. The Serbian striker netted twice in the first half, sandwiching an eye-catching strike by teenager Fabio Carvalho. Mitrovic was denied a hat-trick by Preston goalkeeper Daniel Iversen - but it made no difference to the outcome as victory confirmed promotion for Marco Silva's side. Fulham could effectively secure the title as early as Saturday if they win at second-placed Bournemouth. The Cottagers might have fallen behind early on, with Marek Rodak called into action to thwart Ched Evans and then tip Ben Whiteman's long-range drive over the bar. But any hint of nerves swiftly evaporated in the ninth minute as Joe Bryan won possession and burst down the left flank to set up Mitrovic, who slid the ball through Iversen's legs. Carvalho and Harrison Reed went close to extending the lead as the home side seized control, repeatedly slicing through Preston's defence. It was Carvalho who did eventually grab Fulham's second in the 34th minute, rifling home on his left foot after Neeskens Kebano's cross had deflected perfectly into his path. Mitrovic made it 3-0 just before half-time, reaching the 40-goal mark after another incisive break along the left, with Harry Wilson providing the assist. North End nearly reduced the deficit early in the second half as Rodak produced another fingertip save to foil Cameron Archer, palming his attempt on to the woodwork. But there was to be no dramatic Preston comeback - nor a third goal for Mitrovic, who had two more attempts kept out by Iversen and was eventually substituted with a quarter of an hour remaining. Although Neco Williams' effort from distance whistled just over, Fulham had to be content with the three goals - and the win that wrapped up their third promotion in five years. The clinical Cottagers have shot through the Championship like a bolt of lightning and look set to smash a number of records as they win promotion back to the top tier with four games to spare. Marco Silva's swashbuckling brand of fast transitions and quick passing has seen them score 98 goals so far. They could still break Manchester City's Championship second-tier record, since the launch of the Premier League in 1992, of 108 goals. Silva's men also wrote themselves into the history books in January when they scored 19 goals in three games and were the first English side in 88 years to score six or more goals in three consecutive games. Serbian striker Mitrovic's 40 goals - already another Championship record - have helped propel Fulham out of sight at the top of the table and all eyes will be on him at the start of next season to see if he can finally recreate his scintillating Championship form against the country's top defences in the Premier League. The west London club have been something of a yo-yo club in the past few seasons, with consecutive promotions and relegations to and from the Premier League every season since their 2017-18 play-off final victory against Aston Villa. Emma Jones, BBC Radio London When Marco Silva became the new Fulham manager, he knew he was taking on the job of leading the team straight back to the Premier League. His first task was to rebuild a squad that had been heavily reliant on loans under Scott Parker in the top flight. But also to rebuild the confidence of players who will have felt they hadn't performed as they'd hoped, or hadn't been given the chance, during another relegation season. New signing Harry Wilson made an instant impact with a goal on the opening day. While a 5-1 win in Fulham's first away match at Huddersfield provided an early indication of just what the team might achieve. That big victory also included a first goal of many for Aleksandar Mitrovic and one from young star Fabio Carvalho, as he began to make headlines that are set to lead to a big move to Liverpool. Wilson looks to have been the best of the new additions, with Silva ultimately relying on the old guard to get the results. And while there will be plenty of praise for Mitrovic, Fulham are far from a one-man team with 'Captain America' Tim Ream one of many players who has had an excellent season. The questions though remain the same. What lessons have the club learnt from previous promotions to ensure they stay up this time? Are the players who have got them up good enough to keep them up? And will any new additions be the right fit for the challenge ahead? Fulham head coach Marco Silva: ""All season he (Mitrovic) has been exceptional. I have to manage his condition - you know how he can play with his energy when he is fresh. ""There was a lot of energy from the first minute. We had to get the job done tonight and we need to be proud of what we achieved. ""We delivered to the club and the fans who deserved this. I am proud of the players as this was the goal on the first day - automatic promotion. ""The season has been fantastic for the fans. Last season was really tough for all of them and we have done this for them."" Preston manager Ryan Lowe told BBC Radio Lancashire: ""Congratulations to Fulham. I thought we could have scored in the first five minutes and then maybe the game changes a little bit. ""But you can't give a team like Fulham the opportunities to score that we did - they'll punish you and we found ourselves 3-0 down. ""You only have to look at the star man who scores the goals and that is the difference - they've got that quality. ""I thought we were a lot better second half, but ultimately we were outclassed in the first half."" Formation  4-2-3-1 Formation  3-1-4-2 Match ends, Fulham 3, Preston North End 0.

41,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61115597,Huddersfield Town 2-1 Barnsley: Defeat consigns Tykes to relegation to League One,"Barnsley were relegated to League One following defeat by promotion-chasing Huddersfield Town, who themselves sealed a Championship play-off spot. Jordan Rhodes headed in from close range after a Huddersfield corner was deflected into his path to give the hosts an early lead. Harry Toffolo was then found completely unmarked to tap in with a cool finish to double their advantage just before the break. In a subdued second half, Barnsley found a late consolation through Callum Styles' impressive strike from the edge of the box but it was too late as their fate was confirmed. The Tykes, who stay bottom, are 11 points behind 21st-placed Reading with three games left this season. Barnsley's three-season stay in English football's second tier comes to an end, while Huddersfield move to within a point of second-placed Bournemouth. However, the Cherries have three games in hand on the Terriers and are still heavy favourites to claim the second automatic promotion place. Huddersfield had lost just two of their past 23 Championship games while Barnsley arrived at the John Smith's Stadium having not won since 15 March and having won just eight points on their travels this term. Barnsley needed a victory to keep up their slim hopes of Championship survival but Rhodes made that task even harder when he put the hosts ahead inside four minutes. The former Scotland striker had to wait for confirmation that the goal would stand after a late flag went up for offside from the assistant referee. But it was eventually given after it was judged the ball had deflected off a Barnsley defender as they tried to defend the corner, leading to Rhodes' simple header. But it was Toffolo's goal just before half-time that epitomised Barnsley's position, as the visitors failed to pick his run into the box, leaving him to latch onto Danel Sinani's cross to fire low past Tykes keeper Jack Walton. Styles' late strike was a bitter-sweet consolation for the visitors, who rarely threatened during an abject 90 minutes where Huddersfield controlled much of the match. Relegation after a season of struggle ends an eventful three-year stay in the second tier for the club who have played more games at this level than anyone else. They scored a last-minute winner at Brentford in the final game of the Covid-hit 2019-20 season to miraculously avoid relegation and send Charlton down instead. Gerhard Struber, who had taken over midway through that campaign after the sacking of Daniel Stendel, left soon into 2020-21 for MLS side New York Red Bulls and was replaced by Valerien Ismael. The former Bayern Munich man oversaw a remarkable turn around of the team's fortunes and improbably guided them to a fifth place finish. They fell to defeat by Swansea in the play-offs and Ismael, along with influential captain Alex Mowatt, both left for West Brom. His replacement Markus Schopp won only one of his 13 games in charge, a victory over Coventry in their first home game, and departed in November after a run of seven straight losses. Sweden Under-21 coach Poya Asbaghi took over but failed to win any of his first 11 league matches at the helm, leaving relegation looking inevitable before finally ending his wait with a home victory against QPR. Surprisingly, that kick-started an upturn in fortunes as they won three times in February to give fans hope of staying up, with January loan signings Domingos Quina and Amine Bassi scoring crucial goals. They could not keep the run going though and conceded late equalisers in home games against Stoke and Fulham in the space of four days in March, at a time when victory in both would have seen them climb out of the relegation zone for the first time since 2 October. Still, they retained some hope up until Easter Monday's limp 2-0 home defeat by fellow strugglers Peterborough in a game where they had more shots and more possession but failed to score against a team who had failed to keep a clean sheet away from home all season.

42,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124793,Peterborough United 0-1 Nottingham Forest: Sam Surridge's winner confirms relegation for Posh,"Peterborough were relegated from the Championship as Nottingham Forest kept alive their automatic promotion hopes with victory at the Weston Homes Stadium. Posh needed a win and Reading to drop points to maintain their slim chance of escaping the drop, but Sam Surridge's goal sent them back to League One. Brennan Johnson's fine cross to the back post picked out Surridge whose header back across goal found the far corner just before the break. A seventh win in eight games leaves Forest fourth and cuts the gap to second-placed Bournemouth to five points with four games left after the Cherries' draw with Fulham. Peterborough's defeat means all three relegation places have been confirmed with two games of the season left, with Barnsley having their fate sealed on Friday, and Derby dropping into League One on Monday. Forest, meanwhile, need just one more point to guarantee their play-off berth, but Steve Cooper's side still harbour even bigger ambitions despite Bournemouth's last-gasp penalty equaliser. Posh went close early on when Ricky-Jade Jones made space and forced Forest goalkeeper Brice Samba into a fine one-handed save, and the home fans had further hope when relegation rivals Reading fell behind. But it proved short-lived as Forest - who lacked spark in the first half - went ahead with only their second attempt thanks to Surridge's fifth goal of the season courtesy of more impressive play from Johnson. The hosts stepped up their urgency in the second half, but struggled to break down the visitors' defence, Harrison Burrows going closest with a strike which forced Samba to save at his near post. Yet it was Forest who went closest to the game's second goal late on, second-half substitute Lewis Grabban seeing a strike ruled out for offside before firing a first-time shot wide from close range. A difficult season has seen Posh struggle to replicate the form that saw them win automatic promotion from League One a year ago, conceding 84 goals - only Reading have leaked more in the Championship. With a run of 15 league games without a win between December and March, the club at one point looked resigned to its fate before showing fight which included wins over Barnsley, Blackburn and QPR. McCann - who himself finished above Peterborough in winning the league with Hull - was reappointed at London Road two months ago after former boss Darren Ferguson resigned and left the club for a third time. It represented something of a merry-go-round for the club and the Northern Irishman - who played for the club between 2010 and 2015 and previously managed them before being sacked in 2018 after no wins in seven matches. To rub salt into the wound, McCann lost to Hull in his opening match, weeks after the Tigers sacked him following their takeover by a Turkish consortium. Injuries to key players including strikers Jack Marriott have depleted their squad, while Jonson Clarke-Harris has scored 11 league goals compared to the 31 that won him last season's League One golden boot. Francis Green, former Peterborough striker and BBC Radio Cambridgeshire co-commentator A lot of people will say recruitment will be probably the main reason Posh have gone down. If you do get that wrong, ultimately it's going to cost you in the long run. Most will probably look at this as an opportunity missed because it took eight seasons to get back in the Championship and all of a sudden now, with some of the clubs that may be in League One next season - the likes of Derby, Sunderland, Ipswich - it's going to be very hard to get out. It obviously took until February for a managerial switch, with Grant McCann replacing Darren Ferguson, but still as a squad I don't think they'd have been good enough to stay in the Championship even if they made a change a little bit earlier. It's going to be a big, big challenge next season. When Posh did get promoted last season there was no-one in the grounds - you're not going to get a season like that again - it was a one-off type of season. These players are obviously capable of challenging for promotion next season, there's no doubt, and if they implement a way that McCann wants to play - and add a few players - then they've got a good opportunity, but they need to get it right from pre-season. Peterborough United boss Grant McCann told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: ""Today I couldn't fault the effort and attitude of the players. They have gone toe-to-toe with probably the best team in the league at the minute and were probably the better team over the first half. ""It's a disappointing day. I told the players you have got to feel this pain and use it to your advantage because the comeback's always stronger than the failure. ""I'm proud of everyone since I've come in. The help and support I've had from everyone at the football club has been great and I know that's going to continue for the remainder of the season and next season. ""We would love to get to the stage, hopefully under my tenure, where we are a sustainable Championship club and we're pushing, but one step at a time. We have to make sure we get out of the league (League One) next year."" Nottingham Forest head coach Steve Cooper told BBC Radio Nottingham: ""There's work to do (to reach the play-offs). I haven't looked at it (the table) if I'm honest - I don't even know what the other results are. ""We'll just stick to our plans. It's a busy period, four games left, so concentrate on our work, recover well and get down to Fulham and try and be in the best shape possible. ""Once we got the lead it was always going to be about managing it a little bit. Truth be told we should have probably got a second and third goal, particularly a second because they were always going to throw more players at the top end of the pitch. ""Credit to Peterborough, they really put up a good fight today. They've got a lot of good young players. It's easy to say now, on a day like today, but I have a lot of respect for Grant and he knows that."" Formation  3-4-1-2 Formation  3-4-1-2 Match ends, Peterborough United 0, Nottingham Forest 1.

43,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963575,Doncaster Rovers 2-0 Crewe Alexandra: David Artell's side relegated from League One,"Crewe Alexandra have been relegated from League One following Saturday's defeat by Doncaster Rovers. Tommy Rowe and Josh Martin scored either side of half-time to condemn the Alex to their eighth successive loss - and their 15th in 16 games. Crewe were only promoted to the third tier in 2019-20 but, after finishing 12th last season, have now suffered relegation with four matches still to play. Rovers, 23rd in the table, boosted their own survival hopes by halting a six-game winless run with a victory that leaves them five points from safety. Crewe had remained in touch with the teams above them and were only four points adrift when they beat Charlton on 12 January - but they have taken just four points from the 51 available since then. David Artell's side go down having clocked up just six league wins - crucially just four of them at home, as was the case the last time they got relegated back to League Two under Steve Davis in 2016. The defeat by Rovers also means they have lost eight games in a row for the first time since 1982. Crewe manager David Artell told BBC Radio Stoke: ""I can only apologise to the fans for the season we've had, it's been a season to forget for lots of reasons and it culminates in this afternoon. I've learnt more in this last 12 months than I had in the previous four-and-a-half years without a shadow of a doubt. ""I'm number one in the firing line as responsibility travels upwards and the fact that none of the fans were having a go at any of the players shows the good job I do at protecting the lads. I'm going to carry on until somebody tells me otherwise; we've rebuilt once and we'll do it again, I can promise people that."" Graham McGarry, BBC Radio Stoke's Crewe Alexandra reporter since 1988 The current managerial team and the squad of Crewe Alexandra players will look back on the 2021-2022 season as one of the worst in the modern-day history of the club. Unfortunately the team's poor performances have led to many unwanted statistics, which are now associated to this group. But the loss of their League One status is top of that list. The departure of five players who featured heavily last season all to Championship clubs, dreadful recruitment, long-term injuries, and the switching of systems and personnel far too often have all played a part in why Crewe are swapping Charlton for Colchester come next August. At any other club than Crewe, with such a shocking set of results, the manager would have been fired. But it looks pretty certain that David Artell will be handed the opportunity to lead a massive rebuilding programme - and he will need to hit the ground running in August or he may not be around to celebrate a sixth year in charge.

44,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61124970,Bristol Rovers 0-0 Forest Green Rovers: Forest Green promoted after draw,"Forest Green Rovers have been promoted to League One for the first time in their history, following a goalless draw at Bristol Rovers. The Gloucestershire team have been at the top of the table since September and are now eight points clear of fourth-placed Port Vale, who have only two matches remaining to Forest Green's three. Jamille Matt, Jack Aitchison and Nicky Cadden were all denied by Bristol Rovers goalkeeper James Belshaw in the second half, while Luke McGee produced a fine save to thwart Luke Thomas at the other end. Bristol Rovers remain in fifth place, two points away from the automatic promotion places with two games left. Having looked to be racing towards League One only a few months ago, Forest Green have seen their push towards the automatic promotion finish line stumble of late. They fell to a shock 4-0 loss to Barrow on Good Friday, but then beat Oldham Athletic on Easter Monday and knew they needed one point against west country rivals Bristol Rovers to officially secure a top-three finish. Regan Hendry was close to getting an opening goal but his effort was cleared off the line, while Ebou Adams' strike forced Belshaw into making a one-handed save. Bristol Rovers have been on a fine run during the second half of this season and are still in the hunt for a top-three finish themselves, meaning there was little between the sides as Antony Evans and Elliot Anderson also saw chances go begging. But it was Forest Green who looked more like scoring with Matt denied from close range, as Belshaw was called on repeatedly to keep out the visitors. Still, a 0-0 draw has never seemed so welcome to a team as Forest Green staff and fans raced on to the pitch to start the celebrations at full-time. Forest Green's promotion to League One has looked so certain at points this season, it is easy to forget it has only been five years since the club was promoted to the English Football League for the first time. The majority of their 133-year history has seen them more as a local village team than a professional outfit. After falling short in the play-offs in each of the past two seasons, automatic promotion has been the main target for the squad. The appointment of former Wales, Aston Villa and Wolves defender Rob Edwards as manager last summer - the first senior job of his coaching career - has proved a masterstroke. Edwards, 39, has been praised for his forward-thinking approach. He signed few players and focussed on developing the young squad he already had - only seven of their 29 players are over 25 - fitting for someone who earned his coaching stripes working with the England youth teams. Consistency has also been key. Forest Green have sat at the top of the table since September, before going on a run of 19 matches unbeaten into February that pushed them 10 points clear. Remarkably, only 19 players have been fielded in the league and that has shown in their performances. This is a team that knows each other well and how they want to play. Striker Matty Stevens is among those to flourish under Edwards' management. Having spent most of last season out of favour and on loan, this term he has been a regular starter and the team's top scorer. His partnership with Matt up front - the 'Matt Attack' - has been so formidable they have scored 43 goals between them. Things have stuttered since February when Forest Green's unbeaten run came to an end and they went seven matches without a win. The pressure seemed to show and their advantage dramatically receded. But another four victories followed, and while a recent 4-0 defeat by bottom-of-the-table Barrow was a shock, Forest Green have got over the line - the 'little team on top of the hill' have secured a historic promotion to League One. Analysis - Paul Furley, BBC Radio Gloucestershire What a journey it's been for Forest Green Rovers - from the Stroud League in its early days at the start of the 20th century to League One. The club that was founded on a hill high above Nailsworth in 1889 never played an opponent outside of Gloucestershire until the 1970s, yet 40 years on from winning a double of the Hellenic League Premier Division and the FA Vase at Wembley, Rovers find themselves promoted to the third tier of English football. This is their fourth promotion in the last 25 years, the first two achieved under the stewardship of late chairman Trevor Horsley and manager Frank Gregan who took the club from obscurity to a place among the non-league elite and achieved a return to Wembley in the 1999 FA Trophy final. The recurring theme for the club down the years, according to Tim Barnard who wrote its official history and designed its current ground, is that every time it has needed someone to come in and take it to the next level, it has found that person. That is what it has done under Dale Vince as chairman and with Rob Edwards now in charge of the team. He has worked with a squad largely inherited from Mark Cooper's time at the New Lawn and taken them to automatic promotion in League Two.

45,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60357319,Exeter City 2-1 Barrow: Grecians promoted from League Two after Matt Jay winner,"Matt Jay's late winner saw Exeter City secure promotion from League Two as they came from a goal down to beat Barrow 2-1 in a nervy affair at St James Park. The hosts fell behind to a bizarre Cameron Dawson own goal after Remeao Hutton's long throw-in from the left appeared to go straight in. Kieran Phillips hit the bar for Exeter 15 minutes later before the on-loan Huddersfield Town striker superbly broke to get the equaliser. Exeter struggled to create any chances after the break until homegrown skipper Jay coolly finished at the far post from Josh Key's cross from the right. The win sees Exeter return to League One after a decade in the fourth tier. Having started the better the hosts fell behind after Hutton's throw appeared to go straight into the net. But the referee, after a moment of deliberation and a glance at his assistant, gave the goal having judged that it had taken a touch off Exeter goalkeeper Dawson having hit the post. Exeter regrouped quickly as Tim Dieng, Jack Sparkes and Jay all had efforts as they had the better of the possession against a Barrow side assured of a third season in the EFL. Phillips should have put City level when he crashed an effort off the top of the bar from eight yards out after some superb build-up play by Jevani Brown. But he did find the net when Cheick Diabate's headed clearance from a free-kick fell to his feet midway in his own half and the 22-year-old raced through before his right-footed effort deflected off Patrick Brough and beat a wrong-footed Paul Farman at his near post. A nervy second half saw Exeter almost go behind when Hutton beat the offside trap, but his low shot was saved by the legs of Dawson just after the hour mark. But Exeter weathered the storm and Jay - a product of the club's much-vaunted academy who has risen to become skipper - superbly controlled Key's cross before blasting in to send almost 8,000 people in St James Park into raptures. Sam Nombe almost got a third as his shot was blocked after breaking through in the final minute, before Exeter's fans invaded the pitch on the final whistle as they won promotion on home turf for the first time since 1990. Exeter's sixth promotion in their 121-year history came after six years of heartbreaking near-misses. The Grecians were beaten play-off finalists in 2017 when they lost to Blackpool and again a year later when Coventry City defeated them at Wembley. Matt Taylor's first season in charge ended with City one point outside the play-off places in 2019 before a humbling 4-0 loss to Northampton in a Covid-19 affected play-off final a year later. Last season the Grecians were three points short but this term - including a club-record 20-game unbeaten run - they have impressed and will deservedly take their place in the third tier for the first time in a decade. Exeter manager Matt Taylor told BBC Sport: ""It was strange because it felt like it was one of those nights where it wasn't going to be our night and we might not get that goal. ""When it did come I didn't feel nervous at all, I felt we were in control, we knew what we needed to do, they didn't really have any chances after their goal. ""It was a game of very few chances, their goal was a freak goal and our goal was a big deflection as well. ""We've just got to enjoy these moments because this club and some of these players have been through some difficult moments, and to come through it in the way they have and to get promoted with two games left in the automatic positions is a reflection on that group of players. Exeter goalscorer and captain Matt Jay told BBC Sport: ""I'm absolutely delighted, over the moon, words can't really describe it to be honest. ""This group has been extra special this year, it's a fantastic group, brilliant recruitment and we've really felt together and you could see how much it meant to us at the end. ""The club have been wanting to go up for many, many years, and to finally do that on a special night in front of more than 7,800 fans is a brilliant turnout.

46,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61033835,Leyton Orient 3-0 Scunthorpe United: Iron relegated after 72 years in EFL,"Scunthorpe United's 72-year spell in the English Football League will come to an end as a 3-0 loss at Leyton Orient confirmed their relegation from League Two. Paul Smyth cut in from the right wing, skipped past Ryan Delaney and arrowed a low shot past Rory Watson's near post to put the O's in front early on. Orient doubled their lead six minutes later as Theo Archibald curled a left-footed effort into the far corner of the net from the corner of the 18-yard box. Ruel Sotiriou found himself unmarked at the far post to head in Jordan Brown's deep cross for Orient's third as the Iron's will buckled. Sotiriou almost got his second seven minutes after the break, but he hit the post after Brown's through ball, while Watson did well to deny Archibald after an hour and Hector Kyprianou crashed an effort off the Scunthorpe crossbar six minutes later. The loss - Scunthorpe's 26th in 42 league games - leaves the Iron 16 points from safety with 12 left to play for. Scunthorpe manager Keith Hill, who has seen his side win just two games in the 28 he has taken charge of since November, said he is upset that his side will be playing in the National League next season. ""I'm really sad. I am angry. I don't want to make a bad situation worse with my reaction, which I have done in the past and it's not stood me in good stead, but I'm very, very disappointed,"" he told BBC Radio Humberside. ""I've been disappointed a lot of times, but I've got to hide that disappointment, But the feeling of actually being here as a manager and being relegated, it hurts, it really does hurt. ""It probably hurts me as much as it hurts the supporters because I want to be a supporter of the club that I manage, the team that I coach and it certainly hasn't been good enough. ""Player performance, player individual mistakes, a lack of collectiveness, all these things happen when you're staring down the barrel of relegation. ""We have to compete better individually and collectively to earn the opportunity to try and win a football match, and I don't think we've been competitive enough throughout the course of the season."" In truth the writing has been on the wall for the North Lincolnshire side for the majority of a campaign where they have won just four league matches. Since beating fellow strugglers Oldham 3-1 at Boundary Park on 26 December the Iron have won just once - a 1-0 win over Walsall on 8 February - and this loss at Brisbane Road was their seventh successive defeat. They finished just one place above the League Two relegation zone in 2020-21 and their cause this campaign was hindered when they were placed under a transfer embargo in the summer. Boss Neil Cox was sacked in November with the club bottom of League Two and replaced by former Rochdale, Barnsley and Bolton manager Hill. Hill lost just one of his first seven matches in charge but they never built up any momentum, and last spent a day outside the bottom two on 28 December. Relegation out of the Football League will be hard to swallow for Iron fans, who saw their team play in the Championship in 2011 and compete in the League One play-offs as recently as 2018. However, they were then relegated to League Two in 2018-19 and finished 20th in their first season back in the fourth tier. With hopes of EFL survival drifting badly, boss Hill said after a home defeat by fellow strugglers Barrow on 15 March that he had to change ""the culture"" at the club. ""I'm trying to navigate this football club through some stormy moments to where I can build a positive future in a positive environment,"" he told BBC Radio Humberside. Though there is now certainty of what level the Iron will be playing in next season, the club's next move behind the scenes is unknown. Owner Peter Swann resigned as chairman last month and has acknowledged he is looking for someone to buy the club from him.external-link Lee Turnbull has returned to the club in the role of chief operating officer and Hill will now hope that he is given the chance to turn the club's fortunes around. BBC Radio Humberside's Mike White It's a sad, miserable, heart-breaking day for Scunthorpe United. A club with a storied history that can list legendary England internationals like Ray Clemence and Kevin Keegan among its most notable former players, in addition to club icons such as Jack Brownsword and Barrie Thomas, and even dual-sport star Ian Botham. In recent times, the Iron punched above their weight in the Championship in the mid-to-late 2000s and flirted with it again under the management of Graham Alexander. Many fans believe his 2018 sacking was the start of the decline that's brought them to this point. Recruitment has been questioned in the past few years too, with many fans suggesting now-former chairman - but still club owner for the time being - Peter Swann had too much input, something he has refuted on several occasions. Whilst some fans are angered by the current state of the club and this situation, many almost seem numb to it now and were resigned to their fate a long time before the dreaded 'R' was placed next to their name on the league table. And despite the consistent positivity from manager Keith Hill about the future of the club, I'm not sure the majority of Iron supporters share that sentiment as they've seen that the National League can quite easily turn into a giant abyss that has swallowed up clubs without a hint or whisper of a return to the Football League. Maybe recent talk and suggestion of a takeover could provide the required impetus needed to at least provide the right resources to Hill and his team - and breathe new life back into a club in desperate need of it - but that will have to wait for another day.

47,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61125002,Oldham Athletic 1-2 Salford City: Latics relegated after protest interrupts match,"Oldham Athletic have been relegated from the English Football League for the first time after defeat by Salford City in a game interrupted by a supporters' on-pitch protest against the club's owners. It ends 116 years of league football for the Boundary Park club, and also means they are the first former Premier League team to drop into non-league since its creation in 1992. The Latics, who needed to avoid defeat to keep their hopes of League Two survival alive after wins for both Barrow and Stevenage, trailed 2-1 with 14 minutes to play against Salford when fans poured on to the pitch. The players were taken off by referee Bobby Madley as supporters staged a centre-circle sit-in against owner Abdallah Lemsagam, despite appeals from boss John Sheridan to return to the stands. Protests remained in place for some time after, but once the pitch had been cleared, the teams returned to play out the remaining time behind closed doors. An EFL spokesperson said: ""This afternoon's League Two fixture between Oldham Athletic and Salford City has been concluded behind closed doors. ""The remaining 14 minutes played resulted in a final scoreline of Oldham Athletic 1 Salford City 2, and as a result Oldham Athletic have been relegated from League Two. ""Despite the earlier announcement of the abandonment of the fixture, after discussions with both clubs, match officials, and stadium security it was agreed the match could be concluded today. ""The decision was taken in order to maintain the integrity of the competition given the importance of the fixture at both ends of the League Two table."" Salford, who needed the points to maintain their play-off hopes, took an early lead through ex-Oldham striker Matt Smith who tucked into an open goal. Davis Keillor-Dunn stroked home a penalty to give the home side hope after a handball by Jordan Turnbull, but Brandon Thomas-Asante's near-post header in first-half injury time restored the Salford lead. With pressure mounting, Oldham went for the goal they needed to delay the drop, with Keillor-Dunn's tame chip saved by Tom King after Jamie Hopcutt's header was ruled out. No further score was achieved after the resumption, and Oldham's fate was sealed before eerily empty stands. Relegation to the National League marks a huge fall from grace for a club who were founder members of the Premier League, League Cup finalists 32 years ago and Wembley FA Cup semi-finalists as recently as 1994. In a cruel twist of fate, they are set to begin their first season outside of the EFL on the 30th anniversary of the breakaway division. Oldham's likely drop rounds off a miserable spell for the club in recent times. Keith Curle, appointed in March 2021, looked set to inspire some hope in the beleaguered Latics when he arrived at Boundary Park. Arriving at the club having won promotion from the fourth tier with Northampton as recently as 2020, supporters would be forgiven for thinking he could turn around the fortunes of a club who have slumped to their lowest point in recent memory. It took seven games to find a win in any competition this term and the club's form did not noticeably improve in the first half of the campaign. Curle left in November, just eight months into his tenure, amid the backdrop of heightened tensions with the club's support. Three fans were banned in December for ""promoting their dislike"" of the club, with one of the trio branding it a ""dictatorship"". The bans - which were issued directly by the club and were not court-issued football banning orders - were overturned just two days later after a public outcry, but the damage was done. Protests continued and less than a month later Lemsagam announced that he was willing to sell the club, a U-turn on the position he had taken in September 2021 when he claimed he did not want to. Under his tenure there have been accusations of late payment of salaries and threats of player strikes - as well as the prospect of administration, which was eventually avoided. After more than a month without a permanent manager, Sheridan arrived in January for his sixth stint at the club. Despite a bright run of form in February which took them out of the League Two drop zone, as well as two successive wins in March and April, nine defeats in the past 11 games before Saturday saw a slide into trouble that could not be halted, not even by a club legend.

48,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61149369,Erling Braut Haaland: Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola refuses to speak about Norwegian,"Pep Guardiola refused to talk about Manchester City's prospects of signing Erling Braut Haaland but the feeling is he will end up joining the club. Borussia Dortmund striker Haaland has a 75m euros (£62.3m) release clause. City and Real Madrid have been viewed as the likely destinations for the Norwegian. But with Real trying to secure Kylian Mbappe on a free transfer from Paris St-Germain, City have made Haaland a priority. Blues officials have refused to comment on the situation and Guardiola followed suit when he was asked about fresh reportsexternal-link of a deal being agreed between City and Haaland. ""I have no answer to your question,"" he said on Tuesday. ""I have no concern about what will happen in this club next season. ""We are playing with good strikers and for many years I never talk about transfers, especially when we are playing for this season."" However, Guardiola has spoken repeatedly this season about wanting a number nine after his failure to lure Harry Kane from Tottenham last summer. And, while the City boss remains a huge admirer of Kane, the fact the 28-year-old still has two years left on his contract with Spurs means, financially, signing Haaland now makes more sense. The 21-year-old has enhanced his reputation this term with 25 goals in 26 appearances for Dortmund this season, including a double in Saturday's 6-1 win over Wolfsburg. He has scored 82 goals in 85 games since joining the Bundesliga side from Red Bull Salzburg in December 2019. Haaland is keen to test himself at a higher level and Dortmund have always known they were vulnerable to an approach from one of Europe's biggest clubs. It is anticipated Haaland's agent Mino Raiola will pocket a sizeable fee for his part in the transfer if it does go through and there is understandable caution around the direction of talks until they have reached a successful conclusion. However, within the game, it would now be seen as a surprise if a deal with City was not finally agreed. Guardiola says his physios carried out ""71 treatments"" between last Wednesday's game at Atletico Madrid and Saturday's defeat by Liverpool. The City boss was criticised over his team selection for the 3-2 FA Cup semi-final loss. It came after a 0-0 draw with Atletico which saw them reach the Champions League semi-finals 1-0 on aggregate. Kyle Walker, Kevin de Bruyne and Ilkay Gunodgan suffered knocks in the game and did not feature against Liverpool. The Spaniard used only one substitute at Wembley, leaving De Bruyne and Gundogan on the bench. Walker is still recovering from an ankle injury and will miss Wednesday's Premier League encounter with Brighton. Portugal centre-half Ruben Dias was on the bench at Wembley but after seven weeks out with a hamstring injury, Guardiola says he is ""in the margin"" for selection against Graham Potter's side. ""Our physios made 71 treatments in the space between Atletico Madrid and Liverpool,"" said Guardiola, 51, who defended his FA Cup team selection. ""It's true. I saw the people there. The doctor came to me. How? It's not for one game, it's after three 'finals'."" City played both legs of their Champions League quarter-final with Atletico, plus league and cup games with Liverpool in the space of 12 days. Guardiola did not outline what the ""treatments"" were and said he was not sure what a normal number would be between two games but said ""they told me as it was more than usual"". ",positive
49,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61221249,Manchester City 4-3 Real Madrid: Pep Guardiola's side win thrilling Champions League semi-final first leg,"Manchester City will take a slender Champions League semi-final advantage to the Bernabeu after winning a seven-goal first-leg classic against Real Madrid at Etihad Stadium. City delivered a magnificent display as they peppered Real's goal for long periods but Carlo Ancelotti's side kept rising off the canvas to somehow keep themselves in serious contention to reach another final. Kevin de Bruyne set the tone for a magical night of football with a diving header from Riyad Mahrez's cross in the second minute and in-form Gabriel Jesus quickly added a second from close range as Real reeled under wave after wave of attacks. Mahrez enraged manager Pep Guardiola when he hit the side-netting instead of finding the unmarked Phil Foden, who shot inches wide before Karim Benzema, inevitably, gave Real a lifeline by sweeping home Ferland Mendy's cross after 33 minutes. The Spanish side escaped again shortly after the break when Mahrez struck the post but City restored their two-goal advantage when an unmarked Foden headed home Fernandinho's cross in the 53rd minute. City were pegged back again when Vinicius Junior dummied past Fernandinho and ran from inside his own half to score a superb second for Real. However, a brilliant use of advantage from referee Istvan Kovacs allowed Bernardo Silva to fire into the top-left corner for City's fourth. There was still no let-up and Benzema capped a spectacular game by showing nerves of steel to chip a Panenka penalty past Ederson with eight minutes left following Aymeric Laporte's handball. Liverpool face Spanish side Villarreal in this year's other semi-final, with the first leg at Anfield on Wednesday. The final will be held at the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday, 28 May. City would have taken any sort of advantage to Spain before kick-off but deep down they will know their almost total dominance of Real should have given them much more than this narrow lead for the second leg. Guardiola's side were simply irresistible for spells and could have been four goals ahead before Benzema struck Real's first, the manager clearly infuriated by Mahrez's selfishness in shooting with Foden standing unmarked in front of goal at 2-0. Guardiola and his players will take heart from the manner in which they carved Real open so often and they will hope to capitalise on their opponents' need to press for a goal in Spain. De Bruyne was outstanding once more and Foden just showed how at home he is on the elite stage, but City have to be concerned at how they looked defensively vulnerable on occasion to leave Real very much alive in this semi-final. A side of City's calibre will be confident of progress - but most observers will know this tie should already be over. Real will always have hope when they have Benzema, the 34-year-old Frenchman who deserves his place in the upper echelons of the great strikers in world football. It is often a mystery how Real survive when looking punch drunk having come back from losing situations to beat Paris St-Germain and Chelsea in their previous knockout ties. But a comeback looked beyond them when they were blown away by a blistering City opening that left them two down after only 11 minutes. And yet, for all their struggles elsewhere, the La Liga leaders carry an air of menace that means concentration levels cannot drop for a moment. They proved it again as they dusted themselves down to give themselves a lifeline. It was no surprise that Benzema was the man responsible, showing all of his class with a left-foot volley past Ederson to make it 2-1. Brazilian youngster Vinicius Junior also produced magic for the second goal before Benzema's nerveless penalty. The great survivors are still in this tie and will now hope the magic of the Bernabeu can inspire them once more next week under coach Carlo Ancelotti, who is trying to win the trophy for a fourth time.

50,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52072592,Didier Drogba: How Ivory Coast striker helped to halt civil war in his home nation,"Al-Merrikh Stadium, in Sudan's second largest city of Omdurman, is not one of the world's great gladiatorial arenas. Yet this small ground - known as the Red Castle - became the setting for one of football's most extraordinary tales. The date was 8 October 2005. The mathematics of qualification for World Cup 2006 were simple. A win for Cameroon against Egypt would see them reach their sixth tournament. Anything less would allow Ivory Coast, playing in Sudan and just a point behind, to leapfrog them and qualify instead - for the first time. The tag ""golden generation"" can be a substantial yoke to bear, but the Ivorian squad in 2005 was just that. They were led by the artfully bruising Didier Drogba, with Kolo Toure, Emmanuel Eboue and Didier Zokora all also shining in the Premier League, a world away in London. Yaya Toure, then with Greek side Olympiakos and still considered raw, was waiting in the wings. This was a squad that could match anything on the African continent. Despite having lost twice to Cameroon in qualifying, they remained agonisingly close as they took to the pitch in Sudan that evening. Yet, while Ivory Coast's footballing stars stood on the verge of history, back home the country teetered on the edge of something dark. A civil war that began in 2002 had divided the country, with President Laurent Gbagbo's government controlling the south and a rebel faction known as The New Forces of Ivory Coast, led by Guillaume Soro, controlling the north. Fighting broke out on 19 September 2002 with rebels attacking various cities across the country. Sebastien Gnahore, an ex-footballer who fled Ivory Coast, recalls those times. ""It was awful. When I called my sister I could hear the shooting outside the house,"" he says. ""They all hid under the bed for four days, and only came out to find food. ""All I cared about was whether my family was going to be OK. That's the only worry I had each morning."" The initial violence was fierce but short-lived, as both sides became quickly entrenched along a north-south divide. Much of the fighting had ended in 2004, but tensions were rising once again in 2005. The future of the West African country looked bleak. Modern footballers can seem a world away from the everyday man and woman. The money involved can catapult them into a different realm, and the results can be unpalatable. But the Ivorian players that evening, despite their multi-million-pound lives in Europe, knew much more was at stake. And nobody encapsulated this quite like the man who led their line, and who was about to take centre stage. Didier Drogba had arrived at Chelsea in 2004 for a reported fee of £24m. His nine-year stay in the Premier League was synonymous with a number of things - including a brutally effective, bulldozing style of centre-forward play and accusations ranging from unsportsmanlike behaviour to outright cheating. Love him or hate him, his achievements in west London were unquestionable. Four Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups and a Champions League winner's medal. Arsene Wenger, whose Arsenal side frequently found themselves on the wrong end of Drogba's brutal style, said of him: ""He is a winner and he will be like that until the end of his life."" Drogba was indeed a serial winner, but the pressure on that  October night in Sudan was entirely different. Cameroon's match against Egypt in Yaounde and Ivory Coast's fixture with Sudan kicked off simultaneously. Ivory Coast, knowing nothing less than a victory would do, made short work of a Sudanese side second-bottom in the group. In the 73rd minute, Aruna Dindane tucked away his second goal, and the team's third. An 89th-minute Sudanese strike was no more than a consolation. Events were unfolding relatively straightforwardly - but nearly 1,600 miles away in Yaounde, the picture was very different. Cameroon took the lead in the 20th minute, but the game was tight. A 79th-minute equaliser, bundled in by Mohammed Shawky, brought Egypt level and swung the tide back into the Ivorians' favour. A draw - so long as they beat Sudan - would see them qualify. With just seconds remaining in Yaounde, and with the score locked at 1-1, Ivory Coast looked set for their maiden trip to the World Cup. Their match in Sudan had finished. Drogba was standing, surrounded by his team-mates. They were all listening to the radio and waiting. Then the crushing news filtered through. Cameroon had been awarded a soft penalty in the fourth minute of injury time. For every tale of heartbreak, there must be one of joy. Pierre Wome's spot-kick crashed against the left-hand post and flew wide. The Cameroon players gathered, dazed and despondent in the penalty area, some pulling their shirts over their eyes. On the other side of the continent, Ivory Coast erupted. For the first time in their history, they would compete at the highest level of international football. ""The whole country - every person, every house - was happy. That day we all forgot the country was still divided,"" says Hassane Omar, a 20-year-old student in Abidjan at the time. For all the breathless footballing drama that took place that night, the most seismic event did not occur on the football pitch, but in the cramped away dressing room at the Al-Merrikh Stadium. A post-game prayer led by Drogba had become something of a ritual, but this would be different. With the celebrations unfolding, a TV camera was ushered into the changing room. The players huddled before it, their arms draped across each other's shoulders. Standing in the centre, microphone in hand, was the imposing figure of the Chelsea striker. ""Men and women of Ivory Coast,"" he began. ""From the north, south, centre, and west, we proved today that all Ivorians can coexist and play together with a shared aim - to qualify for the World Cup."" ""We promised you that the celebrations would unite the people - today we beg you on our knees."" On cue, the players sank to their knees. ""The one country in Africa with so many riches must not descend into war. Please lay down your weapons and hold elections,"" Drogba urged. The clip, available on YouTube, is barely a minute long and ends with the players on their feet once more. ""We want to have fun, so stop firing your guns,"" they sang joyously. Back home, the party had already started. There were reports of a conga line outside the Egyptian embassy as Ivorians showed their appreciation for the draw in Cameroon. Even the rebel capital of Bouake bounced to the beat of victory that night. For all the revelry, and for all the 'Drogbas' - bottles of beers renamed in the striker's honour - Ivory Coast still woke up the following morning in the same situation, as a deeply divided country. Yet something was stirring and the following weeks and months were to see a dramatic change. The video clip played relentlessly on television as if the sheer force of media exposure might be enough to enact change. And change did follow. Both sides moved closer to the negotiating table and a ceasefire was finally signed. While any Hollywood scriptwriter would have been proud of this ending, the story was not quite finished. At the 2006 World Cup, Ivory Coast had been knocked out at the group stage, losing to Argentina and the Netherlands before beating Serbia & Montenegro. It was a respectable first performance. The following year, an extraordinary announcement was made by Drogba, while touring the rebel-held area of his homeland after claiming the African Footballer of the Year award. Ivory Coast's home match and Madagascar, due to be played on 3 June 2007, would not be played in Abidjan as scheduled, he said, but instead in Bouake, the symbolic centre of the rebellion. This would have been unimaginable just two years before. Whether presidential permission was given for Drogba's announcement is still not entirely clear. ""Bearing in mind Drogba is from the south - from Gbagbo's area - he was just like a god at the time,"" says Austin Merril, a reporter who was in Ivory Coast working for Vanity Fair magazine. The atmosphere that day in the northern city crackled with anticipation. ""It was completely bonkers,"" adds Merrill, who drove behind the team bus on the way to the stadium with a heavy military presence. People rode on top of cars, weapons slipped from the grasp of excited soldiers. Inside the stadium itself, government and rebel troops hurled football chants back and forth. It was a marked change from the violence of the recent past. ""It felt like more than just football,"" recalls Omar, who was watching on TV in Abidjan. ""Everybody had stopped work at 12 o'clock and was drinking beer or champagne. We were all so happy."" On the pitch, any notion that the script would not be a fairytale was dispelled when Salomon Kalou tapped in on 18 minutes. The goals kept coming. With just five minutes to go, and with Ivory Coast leading 4-0, the stage was set for the spectacular finale everybody had hoped for. A lofted ball from midfield dropped behind the defence, into the path of the onrushing Drogba. Delicate control and a delightful second touch took him round the goalkeeper, and he slid the ball into an empty net. The explosion of noise defied the stadium's modest capacity. The country's messiah wheeled along the running track in celebration, players and supporters streaming in his wake. Above him in the stands, old adversaries celebrated together. The final whistle brought fans rushing on to the pitch, with security personnel forming protective screens around the players, most of all Drogba. The symbolic gesture of the game in Bouake seemed to have united a country once again. ""It was euphoria across the whole country, everybody came together,"" says Gnahore. ""We had so much hope in Drogba and his team. The Toures from the north, Drogba from the south. It was a true Ivorian mosaic."" However, what followed was sadly very different. With divisions running deep, and memories short, the euphoria surrounding those two matches began to fade. Just five years later, violence again gripped the country after disputed elections, resulting in the deaths of 3,000 people and culminating in the arrest of President Gbagbo and his eventual trial at the Hague for crimes against humanity.
