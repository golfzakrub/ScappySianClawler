Liverpool reached the FA Cup final for the first time under Klopp thanks to a devastating first-half display at Wembley, where the Reds led 3-0 at half-time thanks to Sadio Mane's double and Ibrahima Konate's headed opener. City broke free from Liverpool shackles after the break. Jack Grealish reduced the arrears within seconds of the restart before Bernardo Silva's late strike set up a tense finale, but Klopp's side advantage proved insurmountable as the Reds maintained their bid for an unlikely quadruple. ""I think it was [one of our best performances],"" Klopp said. ""That was the feeling I had when I saw the first half because of the quality of the opponent. ""We did all the right stuff, we scored in the right moments; we played an incredible game in the first half, I have to say. I loved each second of it. ""To deny them in so many moments is so difficult, as is creating your own opportunities against them. The first half was outstanding in pretty much all parts of the game. The second half they scored an early goal, like we did [at the Etihad], and then the game opened up. No footballer on the planet is safe against City with a 3-1 lead, it is always clear what they can do. We needed Alisson, what a game he had, but we had our moments as well, and could have decided the game earlier. We didn't do it, but that made the game even more special, 3-2 was a fair result and it was good enough to bring us to the final."" Man City 2-3 Liverpool - Match report Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Saturday's triumph at Wembley kept Liverpool's bid for an unprecedented quadruple on track while ending City's hopes of a treble of their own. With the League Cup already in the bag, a place in the FA Cup final secured, a Champions League semi-final showdown with Villarreal booked, and with just a point between themselves and City at the top of the Premier League, Liverpool could produce a finale like no other to this season, but Klopp was eager to downplay their chances. ""You can mention it how many times you want, it doesn't make it more likely,"" he replied when asked about Liverpool's quadruple hopes. ""A game like today shows even more how unlikely it is. ""To go through against City is incredibly difficult and intense, and in three days we play again against Manchester United. They will be on their toes, and it is historically not a friendly game. ""A few days later we face Everton, that will not be a friendly game. Then we face Villarreal, that will not be a friendly game. Then Newcastle. It's incredibly intense and it is really unlikely the team will win all the games. ""We came here, we wanted to go to the final, we knew about the problems, but with the quadruple, qualifying for this kind of final makes it even more difficult. It is the only way to do it, but it makes it more difficult as well. It is a strange situation, but we are over the moon. We beat the strongest football team in the world and that is a pretty special moment.""

The goalkeeper, selected ahead of Ederson at Wembley, dithered on the ball from a John Stones backpass shortly after Konate's opener, allowing Mane to bundle the ball into the net. ""It was an accident,"" Guardiola told the BBC after the game. ""One of the strong points is try to play [out] and as a keeper he has this quality. ""It was an accident and he will learn for the future. When the ball is there, it can always happen. I have spoken with the team, not him personally, but he is strong."" Guardiola fielded a much-changed side after Kevin de Bruyne and Kyle Walker suffered injuries against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday and claimed Riyad Mahrez and Rodri were the only players on his bench fit enough to actually come on. ""When you play a lot of games, and you continue to do it, always these kind of situations can happen,"" he added in his press conference. ""The game in Madrid was really tough for us. We tried to put energy in the team but sometimes the opponent is good too. ""In the second half we found a goal, which helped us a lot with our momentum.

Six days on from the thrilling 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League, Jurgen Klopp's team appeared to be cruising into the final after scoring three unanswered goals during a one-sided first half as Sadio Mane scored twice after Ibrahima Konate's early header. Klopp later described Liverpool's first-half display as ""one of the best"" of his tenure but City rallied after the break, reducing the deficit almost immediately when Jack Grealish fired home from a Gabriel Jesus pass. Bernardo Silva then set up a tense finale when he slid home from close range in the 90th minute. Liverpool were indebted to Alisson for keeping City at bay before that, the goalkeeper twice denying Gabriel Jesus, while at the opposite end Zack Steffen, picked in place of Ederson, was badly at fault for Mane's first goal, when the 30-year-old charged him down, and his second, when his volley beat him at his near post. Liverpool's victory, jubilantly celebrated by the red-shirted fans who made the trip to a sun-drenched Wembley, ends City's treble hopes and keeps their own dream of a quadruple alive after their Carabao Cup triumph earlier this season. Liverpool will face either Chelsea or Crystal Palace in their first FA Cup final under Klopp on May 14 and they will also hope this win gives them a psychological edge over City as they head into the Premier League run-in separated by a single point at the top of the table. In front of a raucous Wembley crowd, Manchester City had the first sight of goal when Grealish's low effort from Joao Cancelo's cut-back was blocked, but from then on the first half was all Liverpool. How the teams lined up Match stats Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports app Man City: Steffen (4), Cancelo (6), Stones (5), Ake (5), Zinchenko (6), Fernandinho (5), Bernardo (7), Foden (6), Grealish (7), Jesus (6), Sterling (6).   Subs: Mahrez (7).    Liverpool:Alisson (8), Alexander-Arnold (7), Konate (8), Van Dijk (7), Robertson (7), Fabinho (7), Thiago (8), Keita (8), Diaz (8), Mane (8), Salah (7).   Subs: Henderson (6), Jota (6), Firmino (6), Jones (6).    Man of the match: Sadio Mane Guardiola had made seven changes from City's Champions League meeting with Atletico Madrid, with Kevin De Bruyne an unused substitute and Kyle Walker unavailable for selection, and his heavily-altered side could not live with Liverpool's first-half intensity. The opener arrived from a set piece, as Konate rose above Nathan Ake, starting in place of the rested Aymeric Laporte in central defence, to head home Andrew Robertson's corner. Liverpool then doubled their lead in bizarre circumstances as Steffen dithered in possession following a John Stones backpass, allowing Mane to slide in and tackle him, bundling the ball into the net in the process. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It was a glaring error from the American and he was found wanting again for Liverpool's third goal, when Mane's diagonal volley from Thiago Alcantara's chipped pass, following slick Liverpool approach play, flew into the bottom corner at his near post. City looked down and out at that point but they emerged from the half-time break determined to give a better account of themselves and they breathed life into the encounter when Jesus set up Grealish for his fifth goal for the club. The former Aston Villa midfielder took the goal well but Jesus could not match his efficiency in front of goal, twice seeing Alisson deny him after springing the Liverpool offside trap. Mohamed Salah, back in the Liverpool starting line-up having been named on the bench against Benfica on Wednesday, then spurned a glorious opportunity to kill the tie when he chipped wide following a poor backward header from Oleksandr Zinchenko. Salah's miss allowed City to keep the contest alive and their second goal arrived when substitute Riyad Mahrez's angled shot was saved by Alisson and fell to the onrushing Silva to fire home from inside the six-yard box. City had chances to take the game to extra time after that, with Fernandinho blasting wastefully over when unmarked in the Liverpool box and Raheem Sterling shooting straight at Alisson, but Klopp's team held on. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said: ""I think it was [one of our best performances]. That was the feeling I had when I saw the first half because of the quality of the opponent. ""We did all the right stuff, we scored in the right moments; we played an incredible game in the first half, I have to say. I loved each second of it.

They continued to play at a good level but we had chances and the game was there."" As the Mohamed Salah contract saga rumbles on, it is easy to forget there is another member of Liverpool's attack with only a year remaining on his deal. Sadio Mane surely merits just as much fuss. This game was the fifth in a row in which Salah has failed to find the net but it matters little when Mane continues to deliver such devastating performances. The Senegal international, who triumphed over his team-mate at AFCON in February before then helping his country beat Egypt again for a place at the World Cup, followed up his crucial goals against Benfica and in the Premier League against City last weekend with a match-winning double at Wembley. His first goal rewarded his relentless work rate as he closed down Zack Steffen and bundled the ball into the net, while his second showed sensational technique as he guided a volley into the bottom corner from Thiago Alcantara's lofted pass. City could not live with him, instead resorting to fouling him five times across the 90 minutes - no player won more free kicks - and he left the field to rapturous applause from the delirious Liverpool fans inside Wembley when he was withdrawn in the closing stages. His goals kept Liverpool's hopes of a quadruple alive. They were also a reminder that, while he may not attract as much acclaim as his fellow attacker, he is no less influential.

The 2-2 draw between the sides at the Etihad Stadium last Sunday left the Premier League title race in the balance, but Liverpool struck a blow to their rivals with a 3-2 win at Wembley to reach the FA Cup final on Saturday. The first clash of the season between the teams also ended in a 2-2 draw at Anfield in October, and unsurprisingly there is very little to separate the sides in the league, with City holding a one-point advantage with seven matches remaining. It's undoubtedly a two-horse race between City and Liverpool for the title, but how do the run-ins of the two sides compare? What are the key fixtures? And how will City's search for an elusive Champions League title - and Liverpool's bid for a seventh - affect the title race? On paper, there is no question that City have an easier run-in than Liverpool, something that their fans will surely be hoping gives them a crucial advantage as the hunt for the Premier League enters its final stages. Pep Guardiola's side only have three fixtures against sides currently in the top half of the table (Wolves, Brighton and West Ham) and none of them are against sides currently in the top six. The game at Molineux is arguably the toughest City will face during their run-in, for two reasons. The game does not yet have a date having been postponed due to City's participation in the FA Cup semi-finals, making it a harder task to prepare for, while City have only won once in three visits to Wolves since they returned to the top flight under Nuno Espirito Santo in 2018. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Download the Sky Sports app Premier League table City's trip to Brighton on Wednesday looks like a potential banana skin after the Seagulls' recent wins over Arsenal and Tottenham, but the champions have a strong record at the Amex Stadium, winning four of their last five visits and scoring 17 goals. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It's a similar story with the West Ham game, which is live on Sky Sports - City have won four of their last five games in east London by an aggregate score of 18-2. If the Hammers reach the Europa League final next month, that game will fall just three days before City's visit to the London Stadium and will surely take priority over any Premier League fixture, given David Moyes' side are six points adrift of the top four. Guardiola's side will expect to see off Watford, Leeds and Newcastle - the latter two of those games are also live on Sky Sports - but the final-day fixture at home to Aston Villa presents an intriguing prospect. If the title is still on the line, could former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard - who was famously never able to bring the Premier League title to Anfield as a player - get a result at the Etihad and hand his former side the trophy? While City's run-in may lack headline fixtures, Liverpool's is stacked with them. Matches don't come much bigger than Liverpool against Manchester United, and Jurgen Klopp's side must negotiate that task on Tuesday, live on Sky Sports. However, a visit from their struggling north-west rivals does not spark the fear it once did, particularly given Liverpool have not lost at home to United in over six years. They will also know that three points over Ralf Rangnick's outfit will move them back to the top of the Premier League table, given City's next match is 24 hours later. Liverpool then face another huge game next Sunday when Merseyside rivals Everton travel to Anfield, live on Sky Sports. While the Toffees' immediate priority is staying in the top flight, they would love nothing more than to derail the Reds' title bid, and they did win 2-0 at Anfield last season. A trip to St James' Park to take on a Newcastle side that are much improved under Eddie Howe, follows before hosting Tottenham, who are likely to still be desperate for points in their quest to finish in the top four. Antonio Conte's team led twice when they drew 2-2 with Liverpool in December, while Klopp has only beaten the Italian once in his managerial career. A reunion with Gerrard is then on the agenda when Liverpool take on Aston Villa and Southampton - live on Sky Sports - in successive away games before they end their season at home to Wolves. Klopp complained about Liverpool's schedule in the build-up to their win over City on Saturday, and he is unlikely to be happy about the scheduling of their Champions League fixtures in comparison to their title rivals. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The first leg of Liverpool's semi-final against Villarreal on Wednesday, April 27 is sandwiched between their Sunday evening game against Everton and their trip to Newcastle on the following Saturday that kicks off at 12.30pm. City's first leg against Real Madrid is on Tuesday, April 26 and takes place between a Saturday lunchtime game at home to Watford and their trip to Leeds in the evening of the following Saturday. The scheduling means City will have more than 24 extra hours to prepare for their game against Leeds than Liverpool will for theirs against Newcastle - a situation that prompted the Reds to ask the Premier League to move their trip to St James' Park. City will also get an extra day to prepare for their second game against Real, while both they and Liverpool will have three days between their Champions League second legs and their next Premier League fixture. Liverpool have faced the most gruelling schedule this season, playing 52 games in all competitions to City's 49, having won the Carabao Cup in February after City's early exit. Should Klopp's side overcome Villarreal to reach the Champions League final - and with an FA Cup final on the horizon next month - their overall number of games played this season will stretch to 63, a total only surpassed by five sides in Premier League history.

Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick at Old Trafford boosted United's hopes of a top-four finish following defeats for rivals Arsenal and Tottenham, but the result glossed over another underwhelming performance and the home fans were not afraid to show their discontent. Pogba, whose United contract runs out at the end of the season, returned to the starting line-up but struggled to make an impact against the Premier League's bottom side and was replaced by Juan Mata in the 74th minute with the score at 2-2. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The United midfielder was then jeered as he made his way off the pitch before cupping his ears to a particularly critical corner as he went down the tunnel at full-time. Although Rangnick admits he did not hear the boos from a section of disgruntled supporters, he insists he does not agree with their actions. ""I didn't hear it myself, to be honest,"" Rangnick said. ""But we were talking about it with my staff in my office in the locker room. ""I think the fans here are amazing, I really do. The support in the stadium today was again great, it couldn't have been any better. Man Utd 3-2 Norwich - Match report & highlights Premier League table Man Utd fixtures Live football on Sky Sports ""I can understand if that the fans are frustrated and disappointed - so are we. Things have stayed, as far as I know, peaceful all the time. ""I don't think it makes sense to take on and to target any individual person or players because it's a collective responsibility. ""Even if you look into the past, for me it doesn't make sense and this is why I will always defend and protect my players."" The individual brilliance of Pogba's team-mate Ronaldo has put United just three points behind fourth-placed Spurs as the season heads into its final few weeks, but Rangnick's side continue to look defensively vulnerable. Norwich had only scored eight away goals in the Premier League this campaign before their trip to Manchester. Having had 15 shots in the game, Dean Smith's side will undoubtedly feel hard done by not to have come away from Old Trafford with at least a point. Rangnick said: ""We didn't defend well. Both goals we should have defended much better and David de Gea kept us in the game with a brilliant save. ""Overall, it was highly important to win the game, but the way that we played defensively after being 2-0 up was not enough. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's a question of intensity and physicality. Before the first goal, we had the ball at our feet at the sideline but if you are not physical enough in those moments to protect the ball then you can even lose the ball in those areas and within a few seconds they had a free header in our own box. ""It doesn't make sense to look and just be interested in the other results, we have to take care of our own results. Today we got the result but with the overall performance, we definitely have to raise that level against Liverpool on Tuesday and the same away at Arsenal and at home against Chelsea."" As for Ronaldo, he has now scored 60 hat-tricks in his professional career and has 21 goals for United this season in all competitions. ""Like against Tottenham, he was very crucial today,"" Rangnick added. ""The second and the third one were not easy goals, the way he took those two goals was just outstanding.""

Cristiano Ronaldo sealed his hat-trick with a stunning free-kick to rescue a 3-2 victory for Man Utd over Norwich but it was another shoddy showing for the team. Norwich had created chances throughout the afternoon and scored more than one goal in an away game for just the third time this season. Kieran Dowell headed Teemu Pukki's cross past David de Gea on the stroke of half-time, and then the Finland striker beat the offside trap to level seven minutes into the second period. Rangnick said: ""If you look at the two goals we conceded, especially the first one, we had the ball on the sideline but we were just not physical enough. As soon as there is body contact we have to be more physical, more aggressive, but we weren't. ""It was, for me, too easy, and that's why we are probably the only team in the league who concedes goals like this."" He added: ""We should have defended in a smarter way and not allowed them to have two or three transitional moments with playing three versus two or four versus two. To be honest, Norwich could have scored earlier than we did concede the first goal. We could have conceded a goal earlier than that and that's why I'm not really happy with our performance when we were not in possession of the ball."" Ronaldo's 25-yard thunderbolt free-kick winner with 15 minutes remaining restored some good feeling around the ground, and put the hosts right back in contention to finish fourth. They are just three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham. Rangnick on Pogba boos: Not right to target individuals Latest Man Utd news Get Sky Sports Find out more about Sky Sports Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Rangnick said: ""If I just think about the games since I arrived, how many games we have been 1-0 and 2-0 up and in the end only got a point. I mean, this is easily six, eight points that we should have easily have had more. But this brings us back to the same situation that we just didn't defend well enough in moments like this. And [had it not been for] David de Gea with a brilliant save, we could have been 3-2 down and then probably even have lost the game and this should not happen. ""If you want to defend properly in this league, you just have to be physical, you shouldn't just allow them to go past ourselves and through our lines like that. That's what this team doesn't do well enough, and that's why we're still mathematically in the race but we should have easily had eight points more."" The opposition gets tougher for Manchester United next when they travel to Liverpool on Tuesday at 8pm - live on Sky Sports Premier League - as Jurgen Klopp's team have their eyes on the Premier League title. Rangnick has admitted his team could be in for a long evening if they repeat the performance levels from the Norwich win. ""I mean, everybody has seen today's game,"" Rangnick said. ""We all know what team we're playing on Tuesday. ""They won against Man City today, they're in the FA Cup final. In the end they might have the chance to win four trophies this season. ""If we play like we played today, it will be very, very difficult to get even a point out of this game and this is what we have to be realistically aware of. ""So, we need to raise our own level and standard. Probably Fred and Scott (McTominay) will not be back, Raphael Varane will also be a tight race for the game on Tuesday. So far he hasn't trained with the team. ""We have to be aware that the players that we had available today we will drive to Liverpool and just get anything out of that game. ""If possible we need three points. That can happen in football, it has happened before.

The Gunners were beaten 1-0 by Southampton thanks to Yan Bednarek's first-half goal despite having 23 shots and knowing a victory would have taken them level on points with fourth-placed Spurs, who lost to Brighton on Saturday lunchtime. Striker Alexandre Lacazette was missing after testing positive for Covid although the visitors still created enough chances and were denied by a string of fine saves from goalkeeper Fraser Forster.

""It certainly has and we need to find a way to win football matches,"" he said. ""What we can do is play as good as possible to get the team as close as possible to win football matches - today we've done that again. The stats will say, 'How the hell have we lost that game?' but the reality is we lost it."" Arsenal registered just six shots on target out of their 23 attempts but Forster made two particularly impressive saves to deny Bukayo Saka in the first-half before tipping an effort from Emile Smith Rowe behind in the second.

""At the end of the day it's decided in the boxes, they scored one goal, we didn't for that amount of time we spent around the box, the clear-cut chances we had, we didn't put them in the goal because they have an exceptional goalkeeper today, and because we didn't have enough quality to break them down. ""It's what we have. The players we have they haven't done it in this league. World class players have been in the league for 10 years.

Asked how big of an opportunity Arsenal had missed in making up ground on Tottenham, Arteta said: ""Huge. It is very disappointing and difficult to explain with words but this is sport, it's what makes it different to any other. ""I can't remember a game Arsenal have played this season [where we have] created more and better. But the result at the end is what we need to where we have to be.

Spurs were sluggish during a stop-start game on Saturday and were eventually undone by Leandro Trossard's 90th-minute winner, having failed to land a single shot on target themselves during the match. While chances were in short supply at either end, there was first half controversy when Spurs' Dejan Kulusevski swung an elbow at Marc Cucurella and was only booked, and Brighton's Enock Mwepu, who had already been shown a yellow card, escaped further punishment when he was penalised for a high boot on Ben Davies and stood on Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's boot. Tottenham lost Matt Doherty for the season during last week's win at Aston Villa when he suffered a medial collateral ligament injury from a tackle from Matty Cash and Conte says officials must be alert to moments when players take man and ball in tackles. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""Sometimes I think the referee has to pay more attention to protect players,"" Conte said in his post-match press conference, when asked whether about Doherty and 'big tackles' from Brighton. ""I understand you go and you take the ball but if you go to take half ball and half body and you make damage to the player, it's not the same. ""I think for the safety of the player, the referee has to pay great attention, to understand. Tottenham 0-1 Brighton: Match report Tottenham 0-1 Brighton: As it happened Get Sky Sports Download the Sky Sports app ""If you go to take the ball but when you take the ball and the body and you make damages to your opponent, I think you have to make a big punishment. ""I was a player, I know the way to do it. If I want to make a problem, an opponent an injury, I find the right time to go for the ball and the total body. I was a player, I know this! Instead, to take only the ball, I go the ball… but he has taken the ball, yeah but he broke the leg also [referring to Cash]."" Asked about the Kulusevski incident, Conte said: ""Honestly I didn't see. I'm going to see what happened. I think maybe also during the game maybe other players deserved the second yellow card for Brighton. But the referee decided in this way and we have to accept the decision of the referee."" And on the possibility of Brighton players slowing down the match at free-kicks, Conte added: ""This type of situation referees need to be more good. ""It's normal if you are playing and you know that you can get one point - at the end, they got three points - you understand sometimes you have to lose the intensity of the game and with a player to stay lying down. ""But I think the referees, they have to try to give continuity and don't break the intensity of the game with fake injuries."" Reflecting on his team's performance, Conte said Spurs were below their best and should have seen out the final stages for a draw, rather than pushing too hard for victory. ""For sure not a good result for us,"" he said. ""A lesson we can learn today is that there are games that if you're not able to win, you're not to lose. It was very clear that today wasn't our day. ""I understand we want to try to get three points before our other rivals for the race in the Champions League but sometimes we need to feel. ""The game was very difficult, a tactical game from both sides. Brighton were very good to close every space. We moved the ball slowly. We are able to do much better than today. ""Maybe a more fair final result was a draw but Brighton played a good game, well organised with a good manager. If you win against Arsenal and Tottenham away, it means the team is a good team. ""We started very slowly. In my opinion, we can do much better than we showed today."" Meanwhile, Brighton boss Graham Potter was understandably delighted with a second win in north London in as many games, having beaten Arsenal 2-1 at the Emirates last Saturday. And the Brighton boss reckons the win over Spurs topped the performance against the Gunners. ""It feels better than Arsenal. I thought the performance was a step up. The players were incredible, with work rate and discipline. We had good organisation and attitude to run and defend and be brave when we had the ball as well. It wasn't a smash and grab game. ""We were playing against a lot of world class players and a team in a good moment so we had to be good today. 40 points with six games to go. Not so bad considering it was Armageddon three games ago! It was only fair if we beat Arsenal; we have to go to Spurs and beat them.""

Team news Newcastle midfielder Joe Willock could return to the squad for Sunday's Premier League clash with Leicester. Willock missed last Friday night's 1-0 win over Wolves with a knee injury, but has returned to training after having an injection to address the niggling problem. Winger Ryan Fraser, however, is a doubt having picked up a hamstring injury last weekend and illness continues to affect the camp, while defenders Kieran Trippier (fractured metatarsal), Federico Fernandez (side strain) and striker Callum Wilson (Achilles/calf) are working their way back to full fitness. Leicester remain without Jamie Vardy for the trip to St James' Park. The striker is still struggling with a knee injury and missed Thursday's 2-1 Europa Conference League quarter-final win at PSV. Wilfred Ndidi, Danny Ward and Ryan Bertrand (all knee) are also out while Brendan Rodgers will assess those who played in Eindhoven after arriving back on Friday and Nampalys Mendy is available after being ineligible.

Good quality chances have fallen Burn's way in his nine starts for Newcastle, which have equated to an expected goals figure of 0.73. Should the tallest player in the Premier League who has scored a header already this season and plays for a team that have scored 13 of their 34 goals this season from set-pieces, really be 25/1 to score another?

They can no longer block and push for singles. It's time for the manager-less Clarets to swing for the boundaries if they are to catch Everton and Leeds above them. Draws will no longer do. They must add to their pathetic tally of just four wins - and this game will be seen as an opportunity to do so with West Ham's Europa League commitments causing issues with their Premier League form. This change of mentality to playing ""must-win"" football in the last two matches has seen a positive effect on Burnley's attacking metrics - something that will continue to spike over the next few weeks. Games have been much more open affairs with their past two games seeing five goals scored and a total expected goals figure of 8.71 when collating both teams. Travelling to face a West Ham side whose games at the London Stadium average 3.13 goals and have seen both teams score 75 per cent of the time this season, does give this game the look of a goals-heavy one.

On a weekend when not much got my value-seeking radar beeping, my only official bet of Joe Willock and Alexis Mac Allister to score fell pretty flat. Willock wasn't included in the Newcastle squad so that part of the bet was void meaning we had one point running on Mac Allister to score for Brighton at Arsenal at 4/1. The Seagulls attacked with great intent and found a way to the Arsenal goal twice but nothing dropped the Argentine's way.

The sun is shining and all is well after a late turnaround in Eindhoven saw his team progress to the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League. Rodgers is proud of the performance. ""Twenty minutes to go, 1-0 down, and we were still calm,"" he tells Sky Sports. ""We played some great football."" But as he begins to reflect on a special night, other memories of the past 24 hours return. ""It was seeing the happiness of the players and the staff afterwards, sharing that moment with the supporters. We stayed overnight so coming back to the hotel we had all the staff there and had a meal together. That was great. Just the happiness of it all, really."" Sixteen-hundred supporters were there to see it, many more will now be planning their trip to Rome in the last four. ""We saw some supporters in the morning at the hotel who had stayed over. It is the joy. That is what it gives you. The supporters loved it, which is great."" All of which makes one wonder what the mood would now be like had Leicester not mustered that comeback. Thirteen minutes remained when James Maddison levelled the tie. Two minutes of normal time were left when Ricardo Pereira won it for his team. Both the scorers started the game but Ayoze Perez, the player who set up the equaliser did not. Nor did Ademola Lookman, the man whose movement was instrumental in the winner. This match was won thanks to the proactive substitutions of the manager. ""I felt that we had to make the change. We were fine in the game, then we concede a sloppy goal and then we had some really good chances. I said to the guys at half-time that unfortunately when you are in these situations there are no second chances."" Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Get NOW to stream big moments Football features Harvey Barnes was hooked, Marc Albrighton too. Lookman and Patson Daka came on. ""We went with two strikers up there with Madders from the side to start with. Pats is up there with Vardy in terms of being our best presser at the top of the pitch. ""It always sets the tempo."" Rodgers wanted to ""change the dynamic from the beginning of the half and then see how that was looking before making more changes"" - which he did when introducing Perez for Kelechi Iheanacho midway through the second half while still trailing. ""That was the idea. Once we had got Pats up and running in the game, it was a case of getting the extra bodies back in the game centrally."" Maddison changed position again. ""They were playing with two flat midfield players so he could just come in behind that."" It worked perfectly for the first goal. Perez feeding Maddison to crash the ball into the net. ""With Ayoze's position, I just felt that we needed someone in that half space. He had not featured a lot recently but he has trained well and I thought he was excellent."" Lookman's ability in tight areas was crucial for the second. ""They had scored so they were 1-0 up and sitting a little deeper so there was not so much space in behind. They were sitting back to protect the lead. I was then looking at somebody who could move a little bit freer on the inside and the outside."" Just as he planned it, then? ""Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't,"" laughs Rodgers. ""I do go into the game with a script of my own, anticipating what may happen and what may not. I will make a couple of notes and talk that through with my staff. Leading up to the game you are always thinking about it. How it may go and how it may not. ""Then it comes down to just the feel of the game. ""But you need players to be adaptable and flexible to take on what you want them to do."" You need them to be available too. No Premier League team has lost more minutes to injury this season than Leicester. During the bleakest times this winter, when they had won three Premier League games out of 14 and dropped out of the Europa League, not everybody wanted to hear about it. But the impact on performance was huge. In some instances, the effect is obvious. The remarkable Wesley Fofana only made his first Premier League appearance of the season earlier this month and has been hugely missed. Elsewhere, the consequences of the disruption have been a little more subtle. ""There is a snowball effect because other players have to be risked, you are hoping they get through it and then they don't. There is this constant knock-on effect. Some end up playing more than you would like when fatigued and that takes away the intensity of our game. ""It is only now that we are getting players back. Having that ability to make seven changes against Crystal Palace really demonstrated that we have players coming back. Even though we still have one or two out, we have a core now and I can trust the squad."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Palace were beaten, but that rotation was also crucial late on in Eindhoven. ""That selection allowed us to recover players for the game against PSV. In the last 15 minutes of the game, that fitness, that physicality, came through and helped give us the victory."" Expect more rotation in the coming weeks. ""I am just conscious with a number of these players how long they have been out. Wesley, James Justin, Ricardo Pereira, Timothy Castagne - these are guys we have to be careful with. Whatever team we put out there will be an intense, aggressive team. ""I don't go into any game not to win. It is more about the physical requirements, especially against teams that have had a week off. We will always fight, always put out a team to get a result, but for us to do that the team has to be intense, it has to be physical. ""I have a group that I trust now and we also have to manage it because we are playing virtually every midweek and have been for a while now. You cannot ask the same players to do that. Well, you can. But the risk of injury goes up and the level goes down."" Rodgers makes all the right noises about the game against Newcastle on Sunday, talks of the need to ""finish strongly"" in the Premier League, and volunteers the statistic they have three games in hand on a Wolves team that are nine points above them. But he is clearly aware that with only nine games remaining there are limits to what can be achieved in that competition this season. ""The reality for us is that eighth is the highest we can finish now,"" he says. The chance for more Leicester City glory lies elsewhere. This is a team with a taste for it now. ""What we have tried to bring to the club is that winning mentality. It is something you build on each day. In the last three seasons we have been in three semi-finals, won an FA Cup final and a Community Shield. There is an opportunity to win more."" There have been difficult times in between, but a season that began with a trophy celebration at Wembley, could yet end with the club's first European honours. ""Top 10 and a final would be a fantastic season considering everything we have gone through. ""Hopefully, it will be a nice ending for us.""

Their two major top-four rivals lose and they move three points behind Tottenham in fourth. The numbers don't tell the whole story. Ralf Rangnick's side laboured again to a 3-2 win over basement club Norwich, who had scored only 20 goals all season but could have had a hatful at Old Trafford. Come the full-time whistle, the celebrations were muted at best and the most passionate reception was arguably reserved for Paul Pogba, who was booed loudly on his way down the tunnel. All had not been well at United all afternoon, with protests against the Glazer ownership overshadowing the build-up to the game and a large collection of fans waiting until the 17th minute to take their seats to signify the 17 years since the Americans took control of the club. The performance seemed the perfect reflection of their complaints - laborious and underwhelming, and all the more frustrating given the players were already aware Tottenham had handed them an opportunity by losing to Brighton in the early kick-off. United are back in the hunt but in name only. Scraping wins over a team almost certain to be relegated will get them nowhere, and repeat performances against Liverpool and Arsenal over the next week will end their top-four charge as quickly as it has been rejuvenated.Ron Walker Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Premier League table Premier League fixtures Premier League results Watch Premier League highlights As the Mohamed Salah contract saga rumbles on, it is easy to forget there is another member of Liverpool's attack with only a year remaining on his deal. Sadio Mane surely merits just as much fuss. Saturday's thrilling FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City was the fifth game in a row in which Salah has failed to find the net but his dip in form matters little when Mane continues to deliver performances as devastating as this. The Senegalese international, who triumphed over his team-mate at AFCON in February before then helping his country beat Egypt again for a place at the World Cup, followed up his crucial goals against Benfica and in the Premier League against City last weekend with a match-winning double at Wembley. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  His first goal rewarded his relentless work-rate as he closed down Zack Steffen and bundled the ball into the net, and he then displayed sensational technique when he guided a volley into the bottom corner from Thiago Alcantara's lofted pass for his second. City could not live with him, instead resorting to fouling him five times across the 90 minutes - no player won more free kicks - and he left the field to rapturous applause from the delirious Liverpool fans inside Wembley when he was withdrawn in the closing stages. In the end, his goals kept Liverpool's hopes of a quadruple alive. They were also a reminder that, while he may not attract as much acclaim as his fellow attacker, he is no less influential. Resolving his future must be a priority too.Nick Wright Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Manchester City's treble hopes ran aground at Wembley Stadium on an afternoon where the Premier League leaders were comprehensively beaten on the pitch and in the stands. Liverpool's victory was three dimensional. A flawless performance on the pitch was inspired by the staggeringly passionate and vociferous support from their travelling fans. Manchester City didn't stand a chance - and did themselves no favours. Pep Guardiola's team selection undoubtedly contributed to Liverpool's devastating first-half performance, with returnees Nathan Ake at fault for Ibrahima Konate's opener, and stand-in goalkeeper gifting Sadio Mane his first and Liverpool's second. Guardiola pointed to fixture congestion and fatigue as reason for his pre-match alterations, but the defeat owed as much to City's insipidness in attack in the first period as it did the errors. The Spaniard's reluctance to turn to his bench until the 83rd minute for his one - and only - change only exacerbated City's plight. With the Premier League title run-in yet to unfold, and with a potential third and final instalment of City and Liverpool's rivalry to come if both sides reach the Champions League final, this was a startling and sobering reminder of the threat Liverpool pose in one-off games, and even spells of matches. Supported to the hilt, and capable of blowing any team in world football away, this Liverpool performance should serve as a warning to City that while they may well overcome their adversaries over the stretch of a Premier League season, discovering the sprint finish or knockout blow may be required to prevent Liverpool from getting their hands on the prizes they crave.Jack Wilkinson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Perhaps come the end of the season, we'll look back on this weekend as the moment Tottenham let Manchester United back into the top four race. The focus immediately after their defeat at home to Brighton was the prospect of Arsenal drawing level if they could win at Southampton. Some poor finishing from Mikel Arteta's side spared Spurs from that but United are now back in the contest. Whether this round proves to be a let-off or a costly slip-up, Antonio Conte was keen for his Tottenham players to learn their lesson. ""Once you reach a good position in the table you have to try to keep this position,"" he said. ""It's a good opportunity for us to cope with pressure. When you're [in a team that's] winning the league you have to cope with pressure from other results and this is a good opportunity for these players, who needed these kinds of exams for improvement."" For Conte, it's about building the blocks of experience for this Tottenham team to achieve greater things in the future. After all, this is a manager who is more accustomed to fighting for titles than fighting for fourth. The mistake they made on Saturday, he said, was being too anxious to push for victory in the final stages - and leaving the space for Leandro Trossard to grab a late winner at the other end. Playing in the lunchtime kick-off, Spurs' players felt the pressure to put down a marker before their rivals kicked off. ""A lesson we can learn today is that there are games that if you're not able to win, you're not to lose,"" said Conte. ""It was very clear that today wasn't our day. I understand we want to try to get three points before our other rivals for the race in the Champions League but sometimes we need to feel."" There are plenty more twists in this top-four race to come and every point will count.Peter Smith ""Forty points with six games to go. Not so bad considering it was Armageddon three games ago!"" Graham Potter took enjoyment in Brighton's return to form in his press conference following the win over Tottenham. There was a dig at the critics who point to their struggles to score goals, too. After a long, bizarre and perhaps tricky to understand run of one win in 13 matches (inside 90 minutes), Brighton have two in two from doing a north London double over Arsenal and Spurs. Watching them up close in both matches, it's hard to believe how a team so well organised could have had such an awful streak. At the back, they prevented a Spurs side, which had scored at least twice in each of their last seven, from having a single shot on target. Lewis Dunk did an excellent job in limiting Harry Kane's involvement. Ahead of him in midfield, Yves Bissouma was superb, with and without the ball. It's in the final third where Brighton have had their biggest struggles this season - as referenced by Potter - but with a slick drop of the shoulder and prod into the bottom corner, Leandro Trossard came up with the moment of quality to deliver a first win at Spurs since 1981. A historic goal and perhaps a historic performance. There was talk in the press room afterwards from long-time Brighton watchers that it may have been their best display since they came up to the Premier League. Potter's view was it was certainly a step up from their display at Arsenal. However you want to rank it, Brighton have ridden through the tough moments this season and have come out the other side with two significant wins. They're back to their best and a strong finish to the season beckons.Peter Smith Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  When questions were being asked of Antonio Conte's position at Tottenham following a 1-0 loss to relegation-threatened Burnley in February, very few people would have predicted the standings would now favour Spurs in the race for fourth place. With six games to play - seven for Arsenal - Spurs hold the fourth and final Champions League spot, but only because teams around them have proceeded to crumble just as they have found some renewed form. Arsenal have wasted chances against Crystal Palace, Brighton and now Southampton to wrestle ascendency in the battle for a top-four finish - it's as if they no longer want it. Mikel Arteta conceded that his side's form is a 'worry' entering the backend of a defining campaign for the Gunners - with this being their third run of three straight defeats under the Spaniard. What's worse is they have now opened the door to Manchester United. What was a two-horse race is now three. A season that promised so much is unravelling quickly for Arsenal, who now need a result from Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night to restore some conviction in their Champions League bid. Arteta's praise of Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster was merited - he kept Saints in the game - but Arsenal did not do enough to dissolve the stopper's purpose. Undoubtedly, there will be further surprises in the race for fourth, but what's certain is that if Arsenal don't improve swiftly, it will not be them playing Champions League football in 2022/23.Laura Hunter Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A smattering of boos at half time told you everything you needed to know about Watford's first-half performance against Brentford. The Hornets were 1-0 down, had mustered one shot on target and were second best in all areas. It was a display that befitted a team winless at home since November. To their credit, Watford were much better in the second half and had Imran Louza not wasted a great chance in the 92nd minute, the Hornets could well have completed a superb comeback win. But such is the way it is going for Watford at home this season, they conceded a last-minute Pontus Jansson winner that saw them crash to a record 10th consecutive home loss - the worst record in the club's history. For Hodgson, the defeat was all down to that sluggish first-half. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He said: ""We really needed each and every player right from the very first minute to be at the top of his game. Now that was by no means the case. ""We did remedy, to some extent in the second half, some of the worst aspects of our first half performance, and we gave ourselves a chance; we equalised and we could even have got that winner. ""But it would have been nice if we could have done it from the very first minute because then maybe we wouldn't even been behind at half time."" The defeat, which leaves Watford second bottom and six points adrift of safety, edges them closer to an immediate return to the Championship. Hodgson's message for their final six games, starting next Saturday at leaders Manchester City? ""One has to believe, one has to keep faith, one has to take some sort of heart from their desire and commitment and effort during the second half,"" the 74-year-old said. ""You just have to hope that six times 95 minutes more, they'll be able to do that and maybe, who knows, we will pick up points we aren't expected to and we will get ourselves back in the race.""Declan Olley Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Brentford are one of the form teams in the Premier League right now. Their last-gasp win at Watford was their fifth victory in six games - only Liverpool have taken more points than the Bees in that period. It means their next two fixtures against Tottenham and Manchester United now look far more complicated for those two top-four chasing clubs than it did at the end of February, when defeat at home to Newcastle had left Brentford winless in eight games. Download Sky Sports app | Get Sky Sports But any concerns that the resurgent Bees are likely to take their foot off the gas now that they are all-but safe from relegation, were immediately dismissed by head coach Thomas Frank after the win at Vicarage Road. ""I'm happy that we are on a decent amount of points, but I want more,"" he declared. ""We're now on 39 points, we're trying to keep focused on winning the next game and finish as high as possible. ""It's been a crazy season for us, a remarkable season."" Things could get even crazier for Brentford though if they were to beat either Tottenham at home next Saturday, live on Sky Sports, or Manchester United at Old Trafford on May 2, also live on Sky Sports. But Frank knows they will have to perform at a better level than their win at Watford if they are to have a say on the top-four race. ""I think in the first-half we were a tiny bit better than Watford, without being fantastic,"" he said. ""In the second-half, Watford had the momentum and were a little bit more on top of the game. ""In football it's very rare that you have these top performances and you win week-after-week. There's also days where you are six or seven out of 10 in terms of performance, and I think that was today.""Declan Olley Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

Pep Guardiola's side have been leading the race to sign Haaland this year and his €75 million release clause means Borussia Dortmund are resigned to losing the striker this summer with their number one target for a replacement Red Bull Salzburg striker Karim Adeyemi. City's most serious competition for Haaland, who has scored 80 goals in 84 appearances during his time at Borussia Dortmund, has been from Real Madrid. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player However, Real's priority this summer is to sign Mbappe as a free agent when his Paris Saint-Germain contract runs out. PSG are willing to do whatever it takes to convince the France international to sign a new contract but he still has his heart set on moving to Madrid, even though some people close to him have advised him to stay in Paris. If Mbappe does leave it will make it even more likely that PSG will try to sign Robert Lewandowski from Bayern Munich. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Haaland is still only 21 but his formidable goalscoring record since his arrival at Borussia Dortmund already places him among the elite.   For Sky Sports' Gary Neville, Haaland's personality, character and persona is as significant as his ability to back up his hopes of achieving greatness on the pitch.   ""I like Haaland's personality,"" Neville said. ""I like that fact he doesn't care what anyone thinks. He's got a bit of Eric Cantona in him, he's the modern-day version if you like.   ""People call it arrogant, I get that, but he has the ability to back it up. You can't teach that. Football needs people like him, it needs personality. We want players with something about them. For every angel, we want a Haaland, a young personality who doesn't do things perfectly.   ""We want professional, well-behaved people, but we also want personality and character and people who are willing to go against the norm, that is what Haaland does."" Lewandowski's representatives will sit down with Bayern Munich to discuss the striker's future in the next few weeks. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Live football on Sky Sports this week Find out more about Sky Sports Both parties will put their proposals forward in the meeting to determine what the next steps will be for the Poland international. The meeting is seen as a top priority, and will happen as soon as possible. Lewandowski's current contract runs out at the end of 2022/2023 season. The Poland international has scored 47 goals in 41 games in all competitions this season and is currently the top scorer in both the Bundesliga and the Champions League. In his eight seasons with Bayern, Lewandowski has scored an incredible 341 goals in 370 appearances and is only behind Gerd Muller in their all-time record scorer list. Barcelona are highly interested in signing Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski. Could Haaland and Mbappe pick up the baton and dominate world football to the extent Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have for the past decade and beyond? Sky Sports' Gary Neville is not so sure. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I don't think Haaland and Mbappe can get anywhere near the levels of Ronaldo and Messi,"" the former Manchester United defender said. ""Haaland and Mbappe are two young players who are massively talented. They can become the best in the world and achieve great things, but we shouldn't think every new, young superstar will automatically take over from Ronaldo and Messi, who are the kind of players you'd be lucky to see once every 80 years.

Meanwhile Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia is expected to remain at the club this summer to oversee the transfer window. It remains to be seen whether she stays permanently after the club has been sold but the three remaining bidding groups would value her input this summer - even if she stays temporarily as part of a handover process. Chelsea could still be major players in the window under new owners although much will depend on the future of club record signing Romelu Lukaku.

Dortmund are six points behind Bayern Munich with only a mathematical chance of the title. Six-time European champions Bayern, eliminated in the Champions League this week, can restore their nine-point lead with a win at struggling Arminia Bielefeld on Sunday. Dortmund took control with three goals in a five-minute spell. Defender Tom Rothe headed home from Julian Brandts corner in the 24th minute, midfielder Axel Witsel pounced two minutes later after Haaland broke free, and defender Manuel Akanji turned in a free-kick from Marco Reus just before the half-hour. Five minutes later, Emre Can netted with a shot from outside the box that goalkeeper Koen Casteels fumbled. Haaland grabbed his first in the 38th minute when he was set up by Reus and shot past Casteels and the prolific Norway star made it 6-0 in the 54th minute after combining well with Brandt. Midfielder Ridle Baku got a late consolation goal for Wolfsburg, who had not scored in any of their previous five visits to the Westfalenstadion. Hungary winger Roland Sallai scored twice as fifth-placed Freiburg beat mid-table Bochum 3-0 to move level on points with fourth-placed Leipzig, who plays on Sunday. Bundesliga table Serie A table Sixth-placed Cologne won 3-1 at local rivals Borussia Monchengladbach to clinch an emphatic Rhine derby double, having won 4-1 earlier this season. French striker Anthony Modeste continued his fine form to put Cologne ahead with his 16th league goal and midfielders Florian Kainz and Dejan Ljubicic added one each to make it 3-0 by half-time. Switzerland striker Breel Embolo pulled a late goal back for mid-table Gladbach. Hertha Berlin boosted their chances of staying up with a 1-0 win at Augsburg, thanks to an early second-half goal from Germany midfielder Suat Serdar. Hertha were 15th and have big games coming up against relegation rivals Stuttgart and Bielefeld. Stuttgart, who were one point behind Hertha in 16th, drew 0-0 at mid-table Mainz. Dusan Vlahovic scored a 95th-minute equaliser to earn Juventus a late point in a 1-1 draw with nine-man Bologna. An acrobatic overhead kick from Alvaro Morata was going wide until the Serbian striker met it with a header at the far post that found the target to salvage a point for the Bianconeri. They had been denied a penalty in a disputed VAR decision moments earlier. Juventus remain fourth, moving within three points of third-placed Napoli, who host fifth-placed Roma on Monday. Marko Arnautovic put Bologna ahead after the break by running onto a through ball from Roberto Soriano and rounding the goalkeeper to slide the ball into an empty net. Bologna's last six goals have all been scored by Arnautovic, who has 12 this season. They are playing for ailing coach Sinisa Mihajlovic, who is in hospital while receiving treatment for leukaemia. Morata thought he had earned Juventus a late penalty when he appeared to be fouled inside the area by Adama Soumaoro, but no penalty was awarded after a VAR review ruled that the foul had occurred outside the area. Soumaoro was issued a red card after the review for dissent. In the ensuing protests by Bologna, Gary Medel was also sent off, leaving the visitors with nine men. Vlahovic - who joined from Fiorentina in January - then notched his 22nd goal this season and the 50th of his career in Serie A. Fiorentina edged visiting Venezia 1-0 with a goal from Lucas Torreira to move up to sixth place and a potential spot in Europe. The Viola have won three straight games, six of their last eight, and are unbeaten in six consecutive matches. Torreira scored from close range following a free-kick, after Igor Julio pulled the ball back from the byline. Torreira, who is on loan from Arsenal, also helped to set up a shot for Jonathan Ikone, which hit the post. Fiorentina moved one point ahead of Lazio and one point behind Roma. The Viola visit Juventus on Wednesday in the second leg of the Italian Cup semi-finals. Venezia remained in the drop zone after a seventh straight loss. Last-placed Salernitana and 17th-placed Cagliari each ended rough periods with wins that could be key for avoiding relegation. Federico Fazio and Ederson scored early for Salernitana as they beat Sampdoria 2-1 and celebrated the southern club's first win in more than three months. It was also Salernitana's first win under Davide Nicola, who was appointed as the club's third coach this season in February. Salernitana remain bottom of the table, but have moved to within four points of safety with two matches in hand. Alessandro Deiola volleyed in before the break as Cagliari beat Sassuolo 1-0 to end a run of five consecutive losses and move six points clear of the drop zone. Meanwhile, Udinese beat Empoli 4-1, which extended the winless streak of last term's Serie B champions to 16 matches. Gerard Moreno scored one goal and set up another before being substituted due to injury during Villareal's 2-1 win at Getafe in La Liga on Saturday. Despite struggling with injuries this season, Moreno has been a key player in Villarreal's impressive run to the Champions League semi-finals, during which they knocked out Juventus and, most recently, Bayern Munich. The striker gave Villarreal the lead in the seventh minute after he scored from a pass by Paco Alcacer. He then helped to make it 2-0 in the 16th minute when he stole the ball in midfield to start a counter-attack. The Spanish international - who also set up Samuel Chukwueze's late winner to topple Bayern on Tuesday - again made the key pass by playing Manuel Trigueros clear to beat David Soria. Unai Emery made seven changes to his starting lineup from the game at Bayern. Moreno had to be substituted in the 61st minute after he was attended to by team doctors and then walked off gingerly. Enes Unal quickly pulled one back for Getafe three minutes later with his 15th goal, second only to Karim Benzema's league-leading 24. Villarreal dug in to end Getafe's unbeaten run of 10 consecutive home games, with their previous loss at Alfonso Prez Coliseum in Madrid coming in late October. Emery's side remain in seventh place, while Getafe slide into 15th. Valencia lost to Osasuna 2-1 in their second-to-last league game before the Copa del Rey final. They play Villarreal on Tuesday then face Real Betis in the Copa final next Saturday. Joselu Matos' second-half goal helped Alaves beat Rayo Vallecano 1-0 and end a seven-round winless streak for the relegation-threatened hosts. Alaves rose out of last place and are four points from safety. Rayo, who were once as high as fourth place, slipped to 14th after their 12th straight game without a victory.

If the 21-year-old can set the record - and you would not back against it right now - then it would cap a fine first two-and-a-half months at Spurs that, despite the doubters, Sky in Italy transfer expert Gianluca Di Marzio had seen coming. ""Kulusevski is a very talented player,"" he told Sky Sports News on Deadline Day when the Swedish international joined the club. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""It's difficult to understand what his real position is, but Antonio Conte is the perfect coach to understand where best to use him in the right system. ""Conte and Fabio [Paratici - Tottenham's transfer chief] are the right couple to allow Kulusevski to reach his highest level."" But surely even Di Marzio could not have foreseen the heights Kulusevski has hit, in what is turning out to be one of the greatest Plan B signings. On the morning of Friday January 28, Tottenham fans woke up to hugely disappointing transfer news. The club's big-money move for Porto's Luis Diaz had been hijacked by Liverpool overnight and the 25-year-old was now headed for Merseyside. Get Sky Sports Get NOW TV - save more than 25% Live football on Sky Sports this week Latest Tottenham news But out of adversity comes opportunity, and three days later, Tottenham signed Kulusevksi on an 18-month loan deal from Juventus. His arrival, though, was not met with much fanfare - and understandably so. Two goals in 27 appearances for Juventus since August, with just seven starts, the move appeared to be a last-minute gamble from Paratici on a player he had signed at Juve two years ago. Those doubts were only exacerbated as Spurs fans watched the club's top target Diaz impress in his first three Liverpool games, as Kulusevski made three unspectacular substitute appearances. It looked like Tottenham had badly missed out. But on Saturday, February 19 everything changed. Just four minutes into his first Tottenham start, Kulusevski gave Tottenham a shock lead at Premier League leaders Manchester City. He then delivered a pinpoint cross for Harry Kane's dramatic 94th-minute winner. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Kulusevski ""played an amazing game"" at the Etihad, according to Conte, and from that moment the Swede has been an ever-present, starting in every match since that 3-2 win at City. As shown by the comparison below, Kulusevski is proving just as effective as Diaz in the Premier League - with the added bonus he is four years younger than the Colombian. ""Tottenham fans are happy Diaz went to Liverpool,"" former Reds defender Stephen Warnock told The Football Show on Sky Sports News, ""because if he hadn't have gone there and gone to Spurs then how would that have worked out? ""We know Diaz is brilliant, but they'll be looking at that thinking, 'We're happy enough with Kulusevski as well'."" Following his goal and assist in the 4-0 win at Aston Villa on Saturday, Kulusevski has been involved in nine goals in his nine Premier League starts. Only four players aged 21 or under in Premier League history have been involved in more goals in their first nine starts. Meanwhile, no player has more Premier League assists than Kulusevski (six, level with Harry Kane) since his first start for Spurs in February. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Warnock said: ""What a signing he's been: assists, goals and intelligent runs. ""He makes the game look really easy and at 21 years of age, it's been quite remarkable how quickly he's settled into the Premier League, having been a bit-part player for Juventus."" Such has been Kulusevski's impact since arriving in January that no player aged 21 or under in the Premier League this season has a better minutes-per-goal ratio than him. And of all the Premier League players with five or more goal involvements, only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (78 mins) and Manchester City's Riyad Mahrez (87 mins) have a better minutes-per-goal ratio than the Swede. But for all of Kulusevski's individuality, it is the way he has completed Tottenham's attack to turn their deadly duo of Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son into a terrifying trio. Watching the front three of Kane, Son and Kulusevski against Aston Villa last weekend for Sky Sports was former Spurs striker Darren Bent. He said: ""Kulusevski and Son either side of Kane just works really well. ""The moment Kane gets the ball, it's like the Red Arrows, you've got Kulusevski and Son running in behind."" The statistics indeed confirm the triumvirate are flying. Twenty three of Tottenham's last 29 Premier League goals scored have involved either Kane, Son or Kulusevski, with 19 of them scored by one of the three. ""Going forwards, Spurs are very clever,"" Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness said after the win at Villa. ""They've got three strikers now who are capable of delivering passes and scoring wonderful goals. They're three players that can nick you games."" Since that win at Man City in February, the trio are the top three providers of goals and assists combined in the Premier League. ""It's a really exciting front three,"" Warnock said. ""We always knew the relationship between Son and Kane - it was formidable. ""Then it was about adding someone into that; it was always [Steven] Bergwijn or [Lucas] Moura, but it was never someone consistent."" If Lucas and Bergwijn had not clicked, then many thought Gareth Bale would be the final piece of the attacking jigsaw last season, but it never really materialised. Kulusevski, though, finally feels like the perfect foil for the evolving Kane and Son. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Swede's direct and fast runs have helped Kane to drop deeper to play defence-splitting passes and display his unique passing ability. In fact, the England captain has provided 17 through-balls, the most of any Premier League player since Conte has came in. Meanwhile, Kulusevski's unselfish play and effectiveness in the final third has unleashed Son in front of goal, with the South Korean needing just one more goal to record his best-scoring league season. A late challenge for the Golden Boot cannot be ruled out either, with Son just three goals behind Salah (20). ""Kulusevski fits in so well,"" former England striker Sue Smith told The Football Show on Sky Sports News. ""It was a bit of a gamble to bring him in, but he's certainly shown it wasn't because the way that he plays with Son and Kane, he makes those runs that are making that front three so effective and work so well."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  For Kulusevski, his rebirth is all down to Conte. Speaking on international duty last month, he said: ""There were many things at Juventus that weren't working and it was very frustrating. I played one match a month always in a new position. My body did not feel good, I did not feel physically strong. ""At Tottenham, there's a breath of fresh air, I have a better rapport with the coach, I was trained better and my physique has improved."" According to a report in the Daily Mail, Kulusevski 'enjoys the focus of Conte's drills' while he has also been influenced by the Italian's off-pitch rules regarding diet. His running stats, as shown below, suggest it is paying off. Kulusesvki's feeling towards Conte is reciprocated by the 52-year-old, having held a long-standing interest in the winger. Following the 5-1 home win over Newcastle, in which Kulusevski got an assist, Conte said: ""We are talking about a player that I know very well, because he played in Italy. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""He started to play with Atalanta, then Atalanta brought [sent] him on loan to Parma, and he played in Serie A. And he played in a fantastic way. ""When I was coach of Inter [Milan], I tried to ask him, but then Juventus moved before. Maybe they put more money than us at the time, and then they bought this player. ""We are talking about a player who is only 21 years old. And he has to continue to play this way. Because he's strong physically, big engine, he's good technically. ""I think for Tottenham, this is a great signing for the present and for the future.""

It's Tottenham's for the taking,"Gary Neville has given his verdict on the race to finish in the Premier League's top four, saying a fourth-placed finish is Tottenham's for the taking after the recent struggles of Arsenal and Manchester United. Tottenham took full advantage of defeats for Arsenal and Manchester United at the weekend with a thumping 4-0 victory at Aston Villa. The results cemented Spurs' position in fourth, taking them three points clear of Arsenal, who do still have a game in hand on their north London rivals. However, Arsenal have suffered back a dip in form since the international break with back-to-back defeats to Crystal Palace and Brighton, and Neville, speaking on The Gary Neville Podcast, expressed doubts about the Gunners' ability to recover. And with Manchester United and West Ham also faltering against Everton and Brentford respectively last weekend, it leaves Spurs firmly in the driving seat. ""I never really trusted Arsenal and I did fear for them,"" Neville said. ""It's three defeats in four now for Arsenal and I said a few weeks ago I didn't trust them fully. The reason behind that was because they needed to prove they could go through a run-in where they were favourites for top four. ""Those doubts are starting to come to the fore."" Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports Watch free highlights after full-time He added: ""I have to say, Tottenham are getting there through the fact they've had a bit of experience in four to five years of getting to the Champions League and basically through the woes of Arsenal and United. ""West Ham have lost this weekend as well [at Brentford] so in some ways it's over to you, Tottenham. They might as well take the Champions League place. Why not? We know they've got an exceptional front two which is now a front three with Kulusevski. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""We know that, but there's still a lot to play for. I think United are done. If I thought the players had anything at all, they could still have a go as they've still got to play Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool but I think they're done. I thought they might have done it a few weeks ago. ""I never considered coming out of the international break they would be in as bad a place as they are so it's now about whether Arsenal can recover but I'm just not sure. I feel it's now Tottenham's for the taking."" Spurs head coach Antonio Conte speaking after his side's win at Aston Villa last weekend:   ""It was a great win for us. Especially when you play a game after your rivals for a place in the Champions League - Wolverhampton, Manchester United and Arsenal - have lost.   ""In this moment you start to feel the blood. It is important in this moment not to fail. We are working a lot on the mentality and the players are giving me satisfaction.   ""For sure, to see this improvement makes me proud. It gives me great satisfaction. At the same time, I know we have to work on this improvement.   ""Because there is not only the tactical, technical and physical aspects but there is the mentality. There is a lot of space for improvement. But today they showed me they have improved this aspect."" While their rivals have faltered, Spurs have hit form at just the right time with four straight wins in the Premier League. Antonio Conte's side have managed six wins in their last seven games, scoring 25 goals in the process to build up a three-point cushion over Arsenal. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  But despite the numbers and their league position, Neville said Tottenham's resurgence is as much down to the failures of their rivals as their own form. ""I don't think they've been spectacular in the last couple of months, but they're almost growing out of the very recent run of Arsenal and what Manchester United are doing,"" he said. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""When you start to play well and the other teams start to drop points, you grow even more. I think that's what happened with Tottenham as I don't think anything spectacular is happening there. In fact, it was only a few weeks ago that Antonio Conte was saying he needed backing in the summer in order to stay. ""The two players signed in January [Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski] have had a big impact but even after that, there was a point whereby Conte was saying, 'Arsenal will finish in the top four or United will'. According to reports, he needed £150m in the summer and needed backing to stay, but all of a sudden the picture has changed."" In his latest column, Paul Merson reflects on why Arsenal could still pip Tottenham to fourth spot, the problems at Manchester United and gives his verdict on the Premier League title race... ""I still feel Arsenal have got a chance. Arsenal have got to go to Chelsea and Tottenham have still got to face Liverpool, which will be a different game. With Chelsea beating Southampton last weekend, that's sort of cemented their top-four place. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""What I would say is that the Arsenal players are at their ceiling. They're playing as well as they can and there isn't too much more in the locker. They had a day against Brighton where they dropped off that level and they got beaten. ""If you take a couple of players out who are very influential in that team and things aren't great. The squad's not big and Mikel Arteta virtually picks the same players all the time and against Brighton, they bumped into a team who had nothing to play for and who had a free swing. ""I felt it would be a dodgy game. Brighton hadn't been playing well but you sensed it would be a nice football match. Arsenal couldn't get their full team out and it became a bit of a struggle. Kieran Tierney is a massive player and Thomas Partey has become increasingly influential. ""I still feel Arsenal are in it because Tottenham have still got a Tottenham in them. I don't mean that in a horrible way, but they still have got a Tottenham in them. Everyone was going mad about them but they could've been blown away in the first half against Aston Villa. ""Villa should've been out of sight and they only have to have one of those days in the next seven weeks. The 4-0 win over Villa covered over the cracks. They did some great stuff, don't get me wrong, but in the first half Hugo Lloris had to make save after save. So I'm still not convinced by Tottenham. ""The top four is still very much on for Arsenal."" If you wish to purchase Tyson Fury v Dillian Whyte on BT Sport Box Office on 23rd April 2022, please visit www.sky.com/boxoffice/btsport .

The American family have been in charge at Old Trafford since 2005 but they have overseen just three major trophy wins - an FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League - in the nine years since Sir Alex Ferguson retired as manager. United's exit from the Champions League at the hands of Atletico Madrid in March means they are currently enduring their worst trophy drought in 40 years, while supporter opposition to the Glazers was increased by their ill-fated attempt to include the club in the European Super League last year. Neville admitted the Super League fiasco was a turning point in his relationship with United's owners, but he believes they can begin to get the fans back on side if they commit to a number of changes at the club - including building a new stadium. Speaking at a Sky Bet fan debate on The Overlap, Neville said: ""I'm really worried at this moment in time. I'd never gone for the Glazer family whilst I was at the club. I saw no reason to - we were successful. ""The Super League was a moment for me where all those owners demonstrated complete and utter greed and disdain for English football. They were willing to ruin it on behalf of their own interests. ""In terms of the Glazer family, post that Super League they said they were going to communicate, they said they were going to change things. They've not changed anything. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week How to watch Premier League highlights ""My view is there is a problem right at the very top. They've had 10 years to prove they can be good football operators beyond Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill (former chief executive), and they've proven they can't do it. ""The first thing that should happen is they should sell the club, because of the Super League, because of their 10 years of failure without Ferguson and that team that he had. But if they really want to stay - because you can never force the Glazer family to sell - then they've got to do four or five things. ""Number one, they've got to stop taking the dividends out of the club if they want to reset the culture. When the owners are pulling money out of the club at the expense of a successful team, it's a bad message from the very top. ""Number two, they've got to pay off that debt and they can do that by selling £500m worth of shares to the fans. They can then rebuild that stadium with a billion quid. It does probably need knocking down to be fair. ""That doesn't need renovation, it needs a new stadium, and that money can be funded from a 20-year contract with a sponsor at £60m, £70m a year. Call it 'something Old Trafford' and we have a brand new stadium that resets the culture of Manchester United, where we have the best stadium in the world. That needs to happen. ""They then need to build a new training ground. Me and Roy (Keane) were part of the squad when we moved 22 years ago. We were devastated to leave The Cliff, but we've now got a training ground that's behind the other training grounds. ""They then need to go and put £100m, £150m a year into a proper sporting project, along with those four things, and then you can say 'the Glazer family have reset the culture of the club'. The fans are on the edge again."" One of the most pressing issues currently occupying the Glazers is appointing a new manager to replace interim boss Ralf Rangnick, who will take a up a consultancy role at Old Trafford in the summer. Ajax boss Erik ten Hag has been interviewed and United are gathering information about the Dutchman, and Neville believes he is the preferred candidate of United's supporters. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""He worked in Bayern Munich when Pep Guardiola was there,"" Neville said. ""We know the impact that had. ""He's won a couple of titles and cups in Holland. His style of play is good. He's got more experience than I think most people think at the age of 52. It's a massive jump but he's got a good coaching pedigree. He's not scarred and that's a good thing - he comes in fresh. ""I did a poll the other day and I was absolutely stunned - 240,000 people voted and 82 per cent were in favour of bringing him in over (Mauricio) Pochettino. I knew that he would be favourite because you can smell it on social media. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I think Manchester United fans are demanding a fresh start and a fresh name. They want something that's completely different that they've not had before, and that's probably gone against Pochettino in some ways."" Roy Keane added that Ten Hag is a ""good option"" for United as they consider what is a ""huge"" decision over their next manager, while he backed his former club to recover after yet another disappointing season in which they are scrapping for a place in the top four of the Premier League. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Asked if Ten Hag was the right man for United, Keane said: ""Well I don't know but he's obviously a good option. I think they've lined up four or five managers to be interviewed and I certainly wouldn't be against that. ""But nobody knows until somebody gets into the building and starts looking at the job that needs to be done. Obviously it's a huge disappointment with the season and there's an important month or two coming up with trying to get into the top four. ""But I've no doubt they'll bounce back. It might take a bit of time but every big club has little periods and United are going through one at the moment. The next manager they get in - it's stating the obvious - is huge. They have to get it right."" Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6. Play for free, entries by 3pm. ",positive,liverpool,0

Arsenal are a decent team - they've got good young players - but they're going to be up and down with their performances. One week they'll be a nine out of 10, the next week they'll be a four out of 10. It wouldn't have surprised me if they didn't beat Watford when they won 3-2, it wouldn't have surprised me if they didn't beat Leicester when they won 2-0 - that's just the way it is, it's a young team. There are ways of getting beat and Monday night at Palace wasn't a good way of getting beat. It was worrying. I expected one of those performances from Tottenham before the end of the season, I didn't expect it from Arsenal. They could lose a game, but not like that. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Palace is a hard place to go on a Monday night, don't underestimate it - and if Arsenal had beaten Palace, I thought top four was done and dusted. It would have been three points clear and a game in hand, it was massive. Now all of a sudden, Arsenal don't really have a game in hand - because Tottenham have got them at home anyway. It doesn't matter what they do with their game in hand, because Tottenham will have to beat them and can overtake them. You watch Tottenham completely and utterly dismantling Newcastle on Sunday. Newcastle aren't the worst team in the world. I watched them at Chelsea a few weeks ago, and bar genius from Kai Havertz and Jorginho, the Blues didn't really look like scoring that day - then Tottenham go and put five past them. Get Sky Sports Get NOW TV - save more than 25% Live football on Sky Sports this week How to watch Premier League highlights Spurs are the favourites for top four now. When Harry Kane's playing like he is, I don't think too many teams are going to beat them. I saw him go to the Etihad and rip Manchester City apart. I saw him rip West Ham apart, I saw him rip Newcastle apart. But you take Kane out of the team, top four ain't happening for Spurs. It's as simple as that. When he doesn't turn up at Burnley away, they get beaten. Tottenham are a one-man team and that's not being disrespectful. You could have a Ferrari, but without an engine in the car it ain't working. He's the all-round package, and that's why he's the best centre-forward in the world, and I've said it for a long, long time. Kieran Tierney is going to be a big miss for Arsenal, after his knee injury before the Palace game. He's one of the players you can't afford to take out of this Arsenal team. He's solid, he's an 8/10 every week, he sets an example. He's a winner - you know what you're going to get with him, and he was a big miss on Monday night. Nuno Tavares had one of them games at left-back, but it's hard when you're out of the team for so long. You're not really playing football - you're just training. Even playing in the U23s, it's not the Premier League. To come in and say: 'Right, play in this game' - you feel for these players. No matter how much you train, it's not the same as playing. I don't think Manchester United are totally out of the top-four race, but David de Gea had to make a world-class save [from Wesley Fofana] - a world, world-class save - to get them a draw against Leicester. The Arsenal result at Palace gives them a chance though. Arsenal and Tottenham have got to play each other, Man Utd have got to play Arsenal, and if results go their way then they are in it. I don't watch them and think 'wow', which I do with Tottenham at the moment. I watch United and I don't see it at all. But they're still in it. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Everyone keeps telling me they have the best players, I don't get that one. If Harry Kane was playing for United, they'd be in the top four. Simple. With United, I just find it's a bit cuffy - it's off the cuff all the way through the club at the moment. Bruno Fernandes is a top player but you can't give him a contract extension as another manager might come in and not like him.

Liverpool reached the FA Cup final for the first time under Klopp thanks to a devastating first-half display at Wembley, where the Reds led 3-0 at half-time thanks to Sadio Mane's double and Ibrahima Konate's headed opener. City broke free from Liverpool shackles after the break. Jack Grealish reduced the arrears within seconds of the restart before Bernardo Silva's late strike set up a tense finale, but Klopp's side advantage proved insurmountable as the Reds maintained their bid for an unlikely quadruple. ""I think it was [one of our best performances],"" Klopp said. ""That was the feeling I had when I saw the first half because of the quality of the opponent. ""We did all the right stuff, we scored in the right moments; we played an incredible game in the first half, I have to say. I loved each second of it. ""To deny them in so many moments is so difficult, as is creating your own opportunities against them. The first half was outstanding in pretty much all parts of the game. The second half they scored an early goal, like we did [at the Etihad], and then the game opened up. No footballer on the planet is safe against City with a 3-1 lead, it is always clear what they can do. We needed Alisson, what a game he had, but we had our moments as well, and could have decided the game earlier. We didn't do it, but that made the game even more special, 3-2 was a fair result and it was good enough to bring us to the final."" Man City 2-3 Liverpool - Match report Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Saturday's triumph at Wembley kept Liverpool's bid for an unprecedented quadruple on track while ending City's hopes of a treble of their own. With the League Cup already in the bag, a place in the FA Cup final secured, a Champions League semi-final showdown with Villarreal booked, and with just a point between themselves and City at the top of the Premier League, Liverpool could produce a finale like no other to this season, but Klopp was eager to downplay their chances. ""You can mention it how many times you want, it doesn't make it more likely,"" he replied when asked about Liverpool's quadruple hopes. ""A game like today shows even more how unlikely it is. ""To go through against City is incredibly difficult and intense, and in three days we play again against Manchester United. They will be on their toes, and it is historically not a friendly game. ""A few days later we face Everton, that will not be a friendly game. Then we face Villarreal, that will not be a friendly game. Then Newcastle. It's incredibly intense and it is really unlikely the team will win all the games. ""We came here, we wanted to go to the final, we knew about the problems, but with the quadruple, qualifying for this kind of final makes it even more difficult. It is the only way to do it, but it makes it more difficult as well. It is a strange situation, but we are over the moon. We beat the strongest football team in the world and that is a pretty special moment."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Pep Guardiola jumped to the defence of Zack Steffen after his error gifted Liverpool their second goal. The goalkeeper, selected ahead of Ederson at Wembley, dithered on the ball from a John Stones backpass shortly after Konate's opener, allowing Mane to bundle the ball into the net. ""It was an accident,"" Guardiola told the BBC after the game. ""One of the strong points is try to play [out] and as a keeper he has this quality. ""It was an accident and he will learn for the future. When the ball is there, it can always happen. I have spoken with the team, not him personally, but he is strong."" Guardiola fielded a much-changed side after Kevin de Bruyne and Kyle Walker suffered injuries against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday and claimed Riyad Mahrez and Rodri were the only players on his bench fit enough to actually come on. ""When you play a lot of games, and you continue to do it, always these kind of situations can happen,"" he added in his press conference. ""The game in Madrid was really tough for us. We tried to put energy in the team but sometimes the opponent is good too. ""In the second half we found a goal, which helped us a lot with our momentum. They continued to play at a good level but we had chances and the game was there.""

Cristiano Ronaldo sealed his hat-trick with a stunning free-kick to rescue a 3-2 victory for Man Utd over Norwich but it was another shoddy showing for the team. Norwich had created chances throughout the afternoon and scored more than one goal in an away game for just the third time this season. Kieran Dowell headed Teemu Pukki's cross past David de Gea on the stroke of half-time, and then the Finland striker beat the offside trap to level seven minutes into the second period. Rangnick said: ""If you look at the two goals we conceded, especially the first one, we had the ball on the sideline but we were just not physical enough. As soon as there is body contact we have to be more physical, more aggressive, but we weren't. ""It was, for me, too easy, and that's why we are probably the only team in the league who concedes goals like this."" He added: ""We should have defended in a smarter way and not allowed them to have two or three transitional moments with playing three versus two or four versus two. To be honest, Norwich could have scored earlier than we did concede the first goal. We could have conceded a goal earlier than that and that's why I'm not really happy with our performance when we were not in possession of the ball."" Ronaldo's 25-yard thunderbolt free-kick winner with 15 minutes remaining restored some good feeling around the ground, and put the hosts right back in contention to finish fourth. They are just three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham.

I mean, this is easily six, eight points that we should have easily have had more. But this brings us back to the same situation that we just didn't defend well enough in moments like this. And [had it not been for] David de Gea with a brilliant save, we could have been 3-2 down and then probably even have lost the game and this should not happen. ""If you want to defend properly in this league, you just have to be physical, you shouldn't just allow them to go past ourselves and through our lines like that. That's what this team doesn't do well enough, and that's why we're still mathematically in the race but we should have easily had eight points more."" The opposition gets tougher for Manchester United next when they travel to Liverpool on Tuesday at 8pm - live on Sky Sports Premier League - as Jurgen Klopp's team have their eyes on the Premier League title. Rangnick has admitted his team could be in for a long evening if they repeat the performance levels from the Norwich win. ""I mean, everybody has seen today's game,"" Rangnick said. ""We all know what team we're playing on Tuesday. ""They won against Man City today, they're in the FA Cup final. In the end they might have the chance to win four trophies this season. ""If we play like we played today, it will be very, very difficult to get even a point out of this game and this is what we have to be realistically aware of. ""So, we need to raise our own level and standard. Probably Fred and Scott (McTominay) will not be back, Raphael Varane will also be a tight race for the game on Tuesday. So far he hasn't trained with the team. ""We have to be aware that the players that we had available today we will drive to Liverpool and just get anything out of that game. ""If possible we need three points. That can happen in football, it has happened before. ""But we have to be realistic, we have to play a lot better if Liverpool is in possession of the ball than we did today."" Ralf Rangnick insists it is not right to target individuals after Paul Pogba was booed off the pitch by some Manchester United supporters during Saturday's 3-2 win over Norwich in the Premier League. Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick at Old Trafford boosted United's hopes of a top-four finish following defeats for rivals Arsenal and Tottenham, but the result glossed over another underwhelming performance and the home fans were not afraid to show their discontent.

Rangnick said: ""I can understand if that the fans are frustrated and disappointed - so are we. Things have stayed, as far as I know, peaceful all the time.

""But we were talking about it with my staff in my office in the locker room. ""I think the fans here are amazing, I really do. The support in the stadium today was again great, it couldn't have been any better.

""Even if you look into the past, for me it doesn't make sense and this is why I will always defend and protect my players."" The individual brilliance of Pogba's team-mate Ronaldo has put United just three points behind fourth-placed Spurs as the season heads into its final few weeks, but Rangnick's side continue to look defensively vulnerable. Norwich had only scored eight away goals in the Premier League this campaign before their trip to Manchester. Having had 15 shots in the game, Dean Smith's side will undoubtedly feel hard done by not to have come away from Old Trafford with at least a point. Rangnick said: ""We didn't defend well. Both goals we should have defended much better and David de Gea kept us in the game with a brilliant save. ""Overall, it was highly important to win the game, but the way that we played defensively after being 2-0 up was not enough. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's a question of intensity and physicality. Before the first goal, we had the ball at our feet at the sideline but if you are not physical enough in those moments to protect the ball then you can even lose the ball in those areas and within a few seconds they had a free header in our own box. ""It doesn't make sense to look and just be interested in the other results, we have to take care of our own results. Today we got the result but with the overall performance, we definitely have to raise that level against Liverpool on Tuesday and the same away at Arsenal and at home against Chelsea."" As for Ronaldo, he has now scored 60 hat-tricks in his professional career and has 21 goals for United this season in all competitions. ""Like against Tottenham, he was very crucial today,"" Rangnick added. ""The second and the third one were not easy goals, the way he took those two goals was just outstanding.""

Their two major top-four rivals lose and they move three points behind Tottenham in fourth. The numbers don't tell the whole story. Ralf Rangnick's side laboured again to a 3-2 win over basement club Norwich, who had scored only 20 goals all season but could have had a hatful at Old Trafford. Come the full-time whistle, the celebrations were muted at best and the most passionate reception was arguably reserved for Paul Pogba, who was booed loudly on his way down the tunnel. All had not been well at United all afternoon, with protests against the Glazer ownership overshadowing the build-up to the game and a large collection of fans waiting until the 17th minute to take their seats to signify the 17 years since the Americans took control of the club. The performance seemed the perfect reflection of their complaints - laborious and underwhelming, and all the more frustrating given the players were already aware Tottenham had handed them an opportunity by losing to Brighton in the early kick-off. United are back in the hunt but in name only. Scraping wins over a team almost certain to be relegated will get them nowhere, and repeat performances against Liverpool and Arsenal over the next week will end their top-four charge as quickly as it has been rejuvenated.Ron Walker Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Premier League table Premier League fixtures Premier League results Watch Premier League highlights As the Mohamed Salah contract saga rumbles on, it is easy to forget there is another member of Liverpool's attack with only a year remaining on his deal. Sadio Mane surely merits just as much fuss. Saturday's thrilling FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City was the fifth game in a row in which Salah has failed to find the net but his dip in form matters little when Mane continues to deliver performances as devastating as this. The Senegalese international, who triumphed over his team-mate at AFCON in February before then helping his country beat Egypt again for a place at the World Cup, followed up his crucial goals against Benfica and in the Premier League against City last weekend with a match-winning double at Wembley. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  His first goal rewarded his relentless work-rate as he closed down Zack Steffen and bundled the ball into the net, and he then displayed sensational technique when he guided a volley into the bottom corner from Thiago Alcantara's lofted pass for his second. City could not live with him, instead resorting to fouling him five times across the 90 minutes - no player won more free kicks - and he left the field to rapturous applause from the delirious Liverpool fans inside Wembley when he was withdrawn in the closing stages. In the end, his goals kept Liverpool's hopes of a quadruple alive. They were also a reminder that, while he may not attract as much acclaim as his fellow attacker, he is no less influential. Resolving his future must be a priority too.Nick Wright Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Manchester City's treble hopes ran aground at Wembley Stadium on an afternoon where the Premier League leaders were comprehensively beaten on the pitch and in the stands. Liverpool's victory was three dimensional. A flawless performance on the pitch was inspired by the staggeringly passionate and vociferous support from their travelling fans. Manchester City didn't stand a chance - and did themselves no favours. Pep Guardiola's team selection undoubtedly contributed to Liverpool's devastating first-half performance, with returnees Nathan Ake at fault for Ibrahima Konate's opener, and stand-in goalkeeper gifting Sadio Mane his first and Liverpool's second. Guardiola pointed to fixture congestion and fatigue as reason for his pre-match alterations, but the defeat owed as much to City's insipidness in attack in the first period as it did the errors. The Spaniard's reluctance to turn to his bench until the 83rd minute for his one - and only - change only exacerbated City's plight. With the Premier League title run-in yet to unfold, and with a potential third and final instalment of City and Liverpool's rivalry to come if both sides reach the Champions League final, this was a startling and sobering reminder of the threat Liverpool pose in one-off games, and even spells of matches. Supported to the hilt, and capable of blowing any team in world football away, this Liverpool performance should serve as a warning to City that while they may well overcome their adversaries over the stretch of a Premier League season, discovering the sprint finish or knockout blow may be required to prevent Liverpool from getting their hands on the prizes they crave.Jack Wilkinson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Perhaps come the end of the season, we'll look back on this weekend as the moment Tottenham let Manchester United back into the top four race. The focus immediately after their defeat at home to Brighton was the prospect of Arsenal drawing level if they could win at Southampton. Some poor finishing from Mikel Arteta's side spared Spurs from that but United are now back in the contest. Whether this round proves to be a let-off or a costly slip-up, Antonio Conte was keen for his Tottenham players to learn their lesson. ""Once you reach a good position in the table you have to try to keep this position,"" he said. ""It's a good opportunity for us to cope with pressure. When you're [in a team that's] winning the league you have to cope with pressure from other results and this is a good opportunity for these players, who needed these kinds of exams for improvement."" For Conte, it's about building the blocks of experience for this Tottenham team to achieve greater things in the future. After all, this is a manager who is more accustomed to fighting for titles than fighting for fourth. The mistake they made on Saturday, he said, was being too anxious to push for victory in the final stages - and leaving the space for Leandro Trossard to grab a late winner at the other end. Playing in the lunchtime kick-off, Spurs' players felt the pressure to put down a marker before their rivals kicked off. ""A lesson we can learn today is that there are games that if you're not able to win, you're not to lose,"" said Conte. ""It was very clear that today wasn't our day. I understand we want to try to get three points before our other rivals for the race in the Champions League but sometimes we need to feel."" There are plenty more twists in this top-four race to come and every point will count.Peter Smith ""Forty points with six games to go. Not so bad considering it was Armageddon three games ago!"" Graham Potter took enjoyment in Brighton's return to form in his press conference following the win over Tottenham. There was a dig at the critics who point to their struggles to score goals, too. After a long, bizarre and perhaps tricky to understand run of one win in 13 matches (inside 90 minutes), Brighton have two in two from doing a north London double over Arsenal and Spurs. Watching them up close in both matches, it's hard to believe how a team so well organised could have had such an awful streak. At the back, they prevented a Spurs side, which had scored at least twice in each of their last seven, from having a single shot on target. Lewis Dunk did an excellent job in limiting Harry Kane's involvement. Ahead of him in midfield, Yves Bissouma was superb, with and without the ball. It's in the final third where Brighton have had their biggest struggles this season - as referenced by Potter - but with a slick drop of the shoulder and prod into the bottom corner, Leandro Trossard came up with the moment of quality to deliver a first win at Spurs since 1981. A historic goal and perhaps a historic performance. There was talk in the press room afterwards from long-time Brighton watchers that it may have been their best display since they came up to the Premier League. Potter's view was it was certainly a step up from their display at Arsenal. However you want to rank it, Brighton have ridden through the tough moments this season and have come out the other side with two significant wins. They're back to their best and a strong finish to the season beckons.Peter Smith Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  When questions were being asked of Antonio Conte's position at Tottenham following a 1-0 loss to relegation-threatened Burnley in February, very few people would have predicted the standings would now favour Spurs in the race for fourth place. With six games to play - seven for Arsenal - Spurs hold the fourth and final Champions League spot, but only because teams around them have proceeded to crumble just as they have found some renewed form. Arsenal have wasted chances against Crystal Palace, Brighton and now Southampton to wrestle ascendency in the battle for a top-four finish - it's as if they no longer want it. Mikel Arteta conceded that his side's form is a 'worry' entering the backend of a defining campaign for the Gunners - with this being their third run of three straight defeats under the Spaniard. What's worse is they have now opened the door to Manchester United. What was a two-horse race is now three. A season that promised so much is unravelling quickly for Arsenal, who now need a result from Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night to restore some conviction in their Champions League bid. Arteta's praise of Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster was merited - he kept Saints in the game - but Arsenal did not do enough to dissolve the stopper's purpose. Undoubtedly, there will be further surprises in the race for fourth, but what's certain is that if Arsenal don't improve swiftly, it will not be them playing Champions League football in 2022/23.Laura Hunter Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A smattering of boos at half time told you everything you needed to know about Watford's first-half performance against Brentford. The Hornets were 1-0 down, had mustered one shot on target and were second best in all areas. It was a display that befitted a team winless at home since November. To their credit, Watford were much better in the second half and had Imran Louza not wasted a great chance in the 92nd minute, the Hornets could well have completed a superb comeback win. But such is the way it is going for Watford at home this season, they conceded a last-minute Pontus Jansson winner that saw them crash to a record 10th consecutive home loss - the worst record in the club's history. For Hodgson, the defeat was all down to that sluggish first-half. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He said: ""We really needed each and every player right from the very first minute to be at the top of his game. Now that was by no means the case. ""We did remedy, to some extent in the second half, some of the worst aspects of our first half performance, and we gave ourselves a chance; we equalised and we could even have got that winner. ""But it would have been nice if we could have done it from the very first minute because then maybe we wouldn't even been behind at half time."" The defeat, which leaves Watford second bottom and six points adrift of safety, edges them closer to an immediate return to the Championship. Hodgson's message for their final six games, starting next Saturday at leaders Manchester City? ""One has to believe, one has to keep faith, one has to take some sort of heart from their desire and commitment and effort during the second half,"" the 74-year-old said. ""You just have to hope that six times 95 minutes more, they'll be able to do that and maybe, who knows, we will pick up points we aren't expected to and we will get ourselves back in the race.""Declan Olley Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Brentford are one of the form teams in the Premier League right now. Their last-gasp win at Watford was their fifth victory in six games - only Liverpool have taken more points than the Bees in that period. It means their next two fixtures against Tottenham and Manchester United now look far more complicated for those two top-four chasing clubs than it did at the end of February, when defeat at home to Newcastle had left Brentford winless in eight games. Download Sky Sports app | Get Sky Sports But any concerns that the resurgent Bees are likely to take their foot off the gas now that they are all-but safe from relegation, were immediately dismissed by head coach Thomas Frank after the win at Vicarage Road.

32,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/30778/12591668/how-do-man-city-and-liverpools-run-ins-compare-and-when-are-cl-semis,Liverpool and Man City's Premier League and Champions League fixtures compared as season reaches climax,"Manchester City and Liverpool have played out thrilling games in the Premier League and FA Cup in the past week, and could even end their seasons against each other in the Champions League final next month. The 2-2 draw between the sides at the Etihad Stadium last Sunday left the Premier League title race in the balance, but Liverpool struck a blow to their rivals with a 3-2 win at Wembley to reach the FA Cup final on Saturday. The first clash of the season between the teams also ended in a 2-2 draw at Anfield in October, and unsurprisingly there is very little to separate the sides in the league, with City holding a one-point advantage with seven matches remaining. It's undoubtedly a two-horse race between City and Liverpool for the title, but how do the run-ins of the two sides compare? What are the key fixtures? And how will City's search for an elusive Champions League title - and Liverpool's bid for a seventh - affect the title race? On paper, there is no question that City have an easier run-in than Liverpool, something that their fans will surely be hoping gives them a crucial advantage as the hunt for the Premier League enters its final stages. Pep Guardiola's side only have three fixtures against sides currently in the top half of the table (Wolves, Brighton and West Ham) and none of them are against sides currently in the top six. The game at Molineux is arguably the toughest City will face during their run-in, for two reasons. The game does not yet have a date having been postponed due to City's participation in the FA Cup semi-finals, making it a harder task to prepare for, while City have only won once in three visits to Wolves since they returned to the top flight under Nuno Espirito Santo in 2018. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Download the Sky Sports app Premier League table City's trip to Brighton on Wednesday looks like a potential banana skin after the Seagulls' recent wins over Arsenal and Tottenham, but the champions have a strong record at the Amex Stadium, winning four of their last five visits and scoring 17 goals. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It's a similar story with the West Ham game, which is live on Sky Sports - City have won four of their last five games in east London by an aggregate score of 18-2. If the Hammers reach the Europa League final next month, that game will fall just three days before City's visit to the London Stadium and will surely take priority over any Premier League fixture, given David Moyes' side are six points adrift of the top four. Guardiola's side will expect to see off Watford, Leeds and Newcastle - the latter two of those games are also live on Sky Sports - but the final-day fixture at home to Aston Villa presents an intriguing prospect. If the title is still on the line, could former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard - who was famously never able to bring the Premier League title to Anfield as a player - get a result at the Etihad and hand his former side the trophy? While City's run-in may lack headline fixtures, Liverpool's is stacked with them. Matches don't come much bigger than Liverpool against Manchester United, and Jurgen Klopp's side must negotiate that task on Tuesday, live on Sky Sports. However, a visit from their struggling north-west rivals does not spark the fear it once did, particularly given Liverpool have not lost at home to United in over six years. They will also know that three points over Ralf Rangnick's outfit will move them back to the top of the Premier League table, given City's next match is 24 hours later. Liverpool then face another huge game next Sunday when Merseyside rivals Everton travel to Anfield, live on Sky Sports. While the Toffees' immediate priority is staying in the top flight, they would love nothing more than to derail the Reds' title bid, and they did win 2-0 at Anfield last season. A trip to St James' Park to take on a Newcastle side that are much improved under Eddie Howe, follows before hosting Tottenham, who are likely to still be desperate for points in their quest to finish in the top four. Antonio Conte's team led twice when they drew 2-2 with Liverpool in December, while Klopp has only beaten the Italian once in his managerial career. A reunion with Gerrard is then on the agenda when Liverpool take on Aston Villa and Southampton - live on Sky Sports - in successive away games before they end their season at home to Wolves. Klopp complained about Liverpool's schedule in the build-up to their win over City on Saturday, and he is unlikely to be happy about the scheduling of their Champions League fixtures in comparison to their title rivals. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The first leg of Liverpool's semi-final against Villarreal on Wednesday, April 27 is sandwiched between their Sunday evening game against Everton and their trip to Newcastle on the following Saturday that kicks off at 12.30pm. City's first leg against Real Madrid is on Tuesday, April 26 and takes place between a Saturday lunchtime game at home to Watford and their trip to Leeds in the evening of the following Saturday. The scheduling means City will have more than 24 extra hours to prepare for their game against Leeds than Liverpool will for theirs against Newcastle - a situation that prompted the Reds to ask the Premier League to move their trip to St James' Park. City will also get an extra day to prepare for their second game against Real, while both they and Liverpool will have three days between their Champions League second legs and their next Premier League fixture. Liverpool have faced the most gruelling schedule this season, playing 52 games in all competitions to City's 49, having won the Carabao Cup in February after City's early exit. Should Klopp's side overcome Villarreal to reach the Champions League final - and with an FA Cup final on the horizon next month - their overall number of games played this season will stretch to 63, a total only surpassed by five sides in Premier League history.

The Gunners were beaten 1-0 by Southampton thanks to Yan Bednarek's first-half goal despite having 23 shots and knowing a victory would have taken them level on points with fourth-placed Spurs, who lost to Brighton on Saturday lunchtime. Striker Alexandre Lacazette was missing after testing positive for Covid although the visitors still created enough chances and were denied by a string of fine saves from goalkeeper Fraser Forster. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Arsenal have slipped to sixth behind Manchester United following their 3-2 victory over Norwich with Arteta admitting his side's top-four challenge has lost its impetus. ""It certainly has and we need to find a way to win football matches,"" he said. ""What we can do is play as good as possible to get the team as close as possible to win football matches - today we've done that again. The stats will say, 'How the hell have we lost that game?' but the reality is we lost it."" Arsenal registered just six shots on target out of their 23 attempts but Forster made two particularly impressive saves to deny Bukayo Saka in the first-half before tipping an effort from Emile Smith Rowe behind in the second. It is the third occasion this season they have registered more than 20 efforts at goal but not scored. Arsenal's fixtures Latest Arsenal news Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments ""It is difficult to explain because this is football, not basketball. In any other sport you win the game very comfortably,"" said Arteta in his post-match press conference. ""At the end of the day it's decided in the boxes, they scored one goal, we didn't for that amount of time we spent around the box, the clear-cut chances we had, we didn't put them in the goal because they have an exceptional goalkeeper today, and because we didn't have enough quality to break them down. ""It's what we have. The players we have they haven't done it in this league. World class players have been in the league for 10 years. I am the first one to defend them, to support them, you see how they tried. The only way to do it is to insist. What happened today might happen next week or the next month."" Arsenal face Chelsea live on Sky Sports on Wednesday before taking on Manchester United and West Ham in a pivotal period. Asked how big of an opportunity Arsenal had missed in making up ground on Tottenham, Arteta said: ""Huge. It is very disappointing and difficult to explain with words but this is sport, it's what makes it different to any other. ""I can't remember a game Arsenal have played this season [where we have] created more and better. But the result at the end is what we need to where we have to be.

Liverpool reached the FA Cup final for the first time under Klopp thanks to a devastating first-half display at Wembley, where the Reds led 3-0 at half-time thanks to Sadio Mane's double and Ibrahima Konate's headed opener. City broke free from Liverpool shackles after the break. Jack Grealish reduced the arrears within seconds of the restart before Bernardo Silva's late strike set up a tense finale, but Klopp's side advantage proved insurmountable as the Reds maintained their bid for an unlikely quadruple. ""I think it was [one of our best performances],"" Klopp said. ""That was the feeling I had when I saw the first half because of the quality of the opponent. ""We did all the right stuff, we scored in the right moments; we played an incredible game in the first half, I have to say. I loved each second of it. ""To deny them in so many moments is so difficult, as is creating your own opportunities against them. The first half was outstanding in pretty much all parts of the game. The second half they scored an early goal, like we did [at the Etihad], and then the game opened up. No footballer on the planet is safe against City with a 3-1 lead, it is always clear what they can do. We needed Alisson, what a game he had, but we had our moments as well, and could have decided the game earlier. We didn't do it, but that made the game even more special, 3-2 was a fair result and it was good enough to bring us to the final."" Man City 2-3 Liverpool - Match report Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Saturday's triumph at Wembley kept Liverpool's bid for an unprecedented quadruple on track while ending City's hopes of a treble of their own. With the League Cup already in the bag, a place in the FA Cup final secured, a Champions League semi-final showdown with Villarreal booked, and with just a point between themselves and City at the top of the Premier League, Liverpool could produce a finale like no other to this season, but Klopp was eager to downplay their chances. ""You can mention it how many times you want, it doesn't make it more likely,"" he replied when asked about Liverpool's quadruple hopes. ""A game like today shows even more how unlikely it is. ""To go through against City is incredibly difficult and intense, and in three days we play again against Manchester United. They will be on their toes, and it is historically not a friendly game. ""A few days later we face Everton, that will not be a friendly game. Then we face Villarreal, that will not be a friendly game. Then Newcastle. It's incredibly intense and it is really unlikely the team will win all the games. ""We came here, we wanted to go to the final, we knew about the problems, but with the quadruple, qualifying for this kind of final makes it even more difficult. It is the only way to do it, but it makes it more difficult as well. It is a strange situation, but we are over the moon. We beat the strongest football team in the world and that is a pretty special moment."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Pep Guardiola jumped to the defence of Zack Steffen after his error gifted Liverpool their second goal. The goalkeeper, selected ahead of Ederson at Wembley, dithered on the ball from a John Stones backpass shortly after Konate's opener, allowing Mane to bundle the ball into the net. ""It was an accident,"" Guardiola told the BBC after the game. ""One of the strong points is try to play [out] and as a keeper he has this quality. ""It was an accident and he will learn for the future. When the ball is there, it can always happen. I have spoken with the team, not him personally, but he is strong."" Guardiola fielded a much-changed side after Kevin de Bruyne and Kyle Walker suffered injuries against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday and claimed Riyad Mahrez and Rodri were the only players on his bench fit enough to actually come on. ""When you play a lot of games, and you continue to do it, always these kind of situations can happen,"" he added in his press conference. ""The game in Madrid was really tough for us. We tried to put energy in the team but sometimes the opponent is good too. ""In the second half we found a goal, which helped us a lot with our momentum. They continued to play at a good level but we had chances and the game was there.""

Striker Alexandre Lacazette was missing after testing positive for Covid although the visitors still created enough chances and were denied by a string of fine saves from goalkeeper Fraser Forster. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Arsenal have slipped to sixth behind Manchester United following their 3-2 victory over Norwich with Arteta admitting his side's top-four challenge has lost its impetus. ""It certainly has and we need to find a way to win football matches,"" he said. ""What we can do is play as good as possible to get the team as close as possible to win football matches - today we've done that again. The stats will say, 'How the hell have we lost that game?' but the reality is we lost it."" Arsenal registered just six shots on target out of their 23 attempts but Forster made two particularly impressive saves to deny Bukayo Saka in the first-half before tipping an effort from Emile Smith Rowe behind in the second. It is the third occasion this season they have registered more than 20 efforts at goal but not scored.

""At the end of the day it's decided in the boxes, they scored one goal, we didn't for that amount of time we spent around the box, the clear-cut chances we had, we didn't put them in the goal because they have an exceptional goalkeeper today, and because we didn't have enough quality to break them down. ""It's what we have. The players we have they haven't done it in this league. World class players have been in the league for 10 years.

Asked how big of an opportunity Arsenal had missed in making up ground on Tottenham, Arteta said: ""Huge. It is very disappointing and difficult to explain with words but this is sport, it's what makes it different to any other.

Both parties will put their proposals forward in the meeting to determine what the next steps will be for the Poland international. The meeting is seen as a top priority, and will happen as soon as possible. Lewandowski's current contract runs out at the end of 2022/2023 season. Bayern Munich CEO Oliver Kahn insists Lewandowski will be staying at Bayern for at least next season. He told Amazon Prime in Germany last night : ""We would be stupid to sell a player who scores 30 to 40 goals per season. We are and will be in talks about his future in the next weeks. ""He has a contract till June 2023 and we'll definitely have him with us for another season."" Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Emery shows magic touch as Villarreal send Bayern crashing out Find out more about Sky Sports Barcelona are highly interested in signing Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski. The Poland international has scored 47 goals in 41 games in all competitions this season and is currently the top scorer in both the Bundesliga and the Champions League. In his eight seasons with Bayern, Lewandowski has scored an incredible 341 goals in 370 appearances and is only behind Gerd Muller in their all-time record scorer list. We reported on Monday that Barcelona are interested in signing the 33-year old. According to Sky in Germany, Lewandowski is open to a move to Barcelona and it is a dream for him to play in Spain. A two or three-year contract is in the making worth £25m to £33m per season as Lewandowski considers his next move. Reports that Lewandowski, who is out of contract in the summer of 2023, has requested a transfer with Bayern officials, however, are not correct. Sky Germany reporter Marc Behrenbeck:   ""We did a lot of research in the last weeks and what we know is that Barcelona are highly interested in Lewandowski, especially because a transfer of Erling Haaland won't happen.   ""And that is what we know at the moment: Barca want him, Lewandowski is open for Barcelona. It was always a dream for him to play in Spain - either Real Madrid or Barcelona.   ""There have been talks already. Xavi desperately wants a world class striker, who can guarantee 30 or more goals a season. A two- or three year contract is in the making with a salary of about 35-40m euros a year.   ""Barcelona are not able to pay high fees but high salaries. There is information from a Polish journalist that Lewandowski has already talked to Oliver Kahn about a transfer in a personal meeting.   ""That's not true to what we know, there was no such meeting. So no request from Lewandowski to Bayern for a transfer."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player To add to Bayern Munich's problems, the German giants were sent crashing out of the Champions League as Samuel Chukwueze's 88th-minute strike secured a dramatic 2-1 aggregate victory for underdogs Villarreal on Tuesday. However, Bayern boss Julian Nagelsmann didn't want to blame the situation surrounding Lewandowski's contract talks for his side's defeat to Villarreal. ""In my opinion there are too many alibis in football,"" he said after the game. ""I'm the one who needs to take the guilt, or the responsibility. It's very popular in sport to shy away from that. ""But I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to give someone else the blame that somehow they were at fault. ""But I will take my lessons in terms of tactics and everything that belongs to the game. If I don't do that then the blame definitely can't be placed on those players whose contracts haven't been finalised."" In March, Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski said about a potential summer move:   ""I am open to everything. I'm quiet,"" he told Sky in Germany.   ""It is important for me to be able to focus on my game, always on what can happen in the last match.   ""Everything that remains to be done regarding the contracts is a secondary issue and remains in the background."" Sky Germany's Florian Plettenberg: ""You could see last night he wasn't at 100 per cent and he's unsatisfied right now - on and off the pitch. It's a very difficult situation. ""Yes, there are talks with him and they have asked him about his future but there's nothing concrete. ""There has been no straight offer to extend until 2024/25 but on the other hand there has been no sign of commitment from the player. It is really possible that he leaves the club this summer or as a free agent in 2023 - the worst case scenario for the club.

For 15 years, the best-player-in-the-world debate has been dominated by two names - Ronaldo and Messi. The global icons have redefined football as we know it, raising an already high bar to unfathomable heights with their goals, professionalism, and longevity. The names Ronaldo and Messi transcend the game itself, but with the duo 37- and 34-years-old, respectively, like all things, their reign is coming to an end and a changing of the guard is in motion. ""We may see cameos or little swansongs here and there, but there is no doubt that Ronaldo and Messi are coming to the end of their careers,"" Neville told Sky Sports. ""That's not to say they are coming to the end of their careers and will retire at the end of the season; Ronaldo and Messi could play three or four more years, knowing their fitness. Declining seems like the wrong word when talking about two great players, but there is no doubt they are declining forces. ""At this moment in time, for the first time in years, if you asked people which player in the world they would sign if I could only pick one, no one would say Messi or Ronaldo, they would likely say Mbappe, Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah, Robert Lewandowski. ""You would be naming players other than Ronaldo and Messi, and that is the clearest sign that, while these two are still operating at the highest level, they are fading from the levels they were at before. They are no longer the best players in the world."" Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports Premier League fixtures Salah, Haaland and Lewandowski are all jostling to succeed Ronaldo and Messi but, as Neville explains, not only is Mbappe already at their level and heir apparent, he has two opportunities to seize the throne this year. ""In terms of excitement, in terms of thrill, in terms of speed, Mbappe is absolutely sensational,"" Neville said. ""He reminds me of Thierry Henry, but he's also got a bit of Cristiano Ronaldo in him - he is ruthless. ""He needs to win the Champions League with PSG this season, that would be the ultimate thing for him. The Champions League, and another World Cup, would be the crowning glory for Mbappe to succeed Ronaldo and Messi. ""I'm not saying he needs to win those trophies to become the best player in the world, but it cements your position if you play for the teams that win either of those trophies. For Mbappe, he knows silverware and honours go with that greatness. ""Mbappe's last-minute goal against Real Madrid in the Champions League was absolutely sensational. The great players win tournaments, they win big competitions, they are influential in big competitions. Mbappe is at that level now."" Mbappe may have emerged as the most credible successor to Ronaldo and Messi, but Neville was keen to stress his journey to true, all-time greatness remains very much in its infancy. Players can have great campaigns and tournaments, inspiring their teams to silverware and notable accomplishments over several seasons. Mbappe's achievements with Paris Saint-Germain and France are evidence of that. But it's the off-the-scale levels of consistency, coupled with success which has spanned decades, which has set Ronaldo and Messi apart, and emulating that represents Mbappe's greatest challenge. ""That is the great challenge for Mbappe,"" Neville added. ""What we mustn't underestimate with Ronaldo and Messi is their resilience; their consistency; the standards season in, season out; the number of games they have played; their toughness, mentally and physically, to withstand all the kickings they will have taken and the criticism they will have had; the pressure and scrutiny that is on them. ""Mbappe has got 10 years before he can even think that he is Ronaldo or Messi. Even if Mbappe gets to their level for one season, he will never surpass Ronaldo or Messi for at least 12 years, because he's got to do it over that length of time to be in the same conversation as them. ""He's got the attributes, he's got the star quality to do a 10-year run of 20, 30 goals a season. But, having said that, that is not even at the level of Ronaldo or Messi. ""To get to those levels, Mbappe is going to have to win three or four Champions Leagues, he's got to score 30 to 40 goals a season for a decade, and he's probably got to go and do it in a country other than France. ""That sounds really disrespectful to France, but I don't think his aspirations of being regarded as the greatest player of all time can be realised there. He's got to go and play somewhere else to prove he can do it in Spain, England, or Germany."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has thrust himself into the conversation for the world's best player title with spectacular goals and performances few playing the game could match. Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher described Salah as the best player in the world on current form after the Egyptian's dazzling performance in Liverpool's 2-2 draw with Manchester City in October, an assessment Neville could not disagree with. Salah is without question world class, he has underpinned Liverpool's success under Jurgen Klopp and helped deliver the club's coveted first Premier League title and a sixth European Cup, but Neville believes Mbappe possesses something Salah doesn't. ""At times earlier in the season, Salah was at a level that was the best in the world, and he still could be,"" Neville added. ""But if you said to me I could sign one player for Manchester United tomorrow, I would still probably go for Mbappe or Haaland over Salah. ""It's not a Liverpool thing, I think Salah is absolutely amazing, but I just think Mbappe has got the ability to be out-of-this-world special. There is no doubt Salah is world class, but Mbappe has got something different, that edge, something that is that good, it could make him one of the true greats."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Erling Haaland is still only 21 but his formidable goalscoring record of 56 goals in 57 Bundesliga games since his arrival at Borussia Dortmund already places him among the elite. For Neville, Haaland's personality, character and persona is as significant as his ability to back up his hopes of achieving greatness on the pitch. ""I like Haaland's personality,"" Neville said. ""I like that fact he doesn't care what anyone thinks. He's got a bit of Eric Cantona in him, he's the modern-day version if you like. ""People call it arrogant, I get that, but he has the ability to back it up. You can't teach that. Football needs people like him, it needs personality. We want players with something about them. For every angel, we want a Haaland, a young personality who doesn't do things perfectly. ""We want professional, well-behaved people, but we also want personality and character and people who are willing to go against the norm, that is what Haaland does."" As for whether Haaland and Mbappe can pick up the baton and dominate world football to the extent Ronaldo and Messi for the past decade and beyond, Neville is not so sure. ""I don't think Haaland and Mbappe can get anywhere near the levels of Ronaldo and Messi,"" he added. ""Haaland and Mbappe are two young players who are massively talented. They can become the best in the world and achieve great things, but we shouldn't think every new, young superstar will automatically take over from Ronaldo and Messi, who are the kind of players you'd be lucky to see once every 80 years. ""Players like these aren't produced every decade. In my time we had Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo, the Brazilian Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho, world-class players who were absolutely sensational, but even as great as they were, they were not Messi and Ronaldo, who are on another planet."" It would be remiss not to reflect on the impact Ronaldo and Messi have had on football, and just how high they have pushed the boundaries beyond what anyone thought could ever be possible. Across their glittering careers, Ronaldo and Messi have won 12 Ballon d'Ors, nine Champions Leagues, 17 domestic league titles between them, and led their respective nations, Portugal and Argentina, to European Championship and Copa America success. This insatiable hunger for success has seen them push each other to ridiculous levels, securing their places in the pantheon of all-time greats while revolutionising football along the way. ""These two players, you could argue, the greatest two players of all time,"" Neville said. ""We are very nervous about suggesting who the greatest players of all time are when they are still playing, we tend to want to give honour and grace to people when they have retired or when they have passed away. ""But I am under absolutely no illusions that these two players will never be out of anybody's top five players of all time, and for most these two will be first and second. ""There might be people who say Pele or Maradona, but Ronaldo and Messi are in the realms of Pele and Maradona, players you never thought would be emulated. What Ronaldo and Messi have achieved is out of this world, the numbers have been unrelenting, obscene."" Neville continued: ""They have not been traditional centre-forwards, which makes the numbers they have hit even more incredible. Purely on goals, Ronaldo and Messi have redefined football. ""Ordinarily the biggest goalscorers in a team have been centre-forwards, wide players were there to assist and cross, but they have redefined how we see the wide striker in football, and the wide striker can now be a 30, 40 goals a season machine. ""Salah and Mane are now doing that at Liverpool, Sterling at Manchester City - they are scoring a load of goals from the wide striker position, and that is all because Ronaldo and Messi have set that expectation at that level. ""Not only have they redefined a position, but they have also created a new one of wide striker, with Ronaldo predominantly on the left and Messi on the right. They have done it for 15 seasons consistently. It is off the scale, ridiculous."" Do not miss your chance to land the £250,000 in Tuesday's Super 6 round. Play for free, entries by 7:45pm.

The Colombia international was manager Jurgen Klopp's first-choice for the summer transfer window, but Liverpool have accelerated their plans due to Spurs' strong interest. Liverpool are said to be offering an initial £37m, with bonuses included in the deal that will only be triggered if Diaz becomes a big success at Anfield. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports News has been told Liverpool have sent a team to Argentina, in anticipation of doing a medical there, with a timescale of about 72 hours expected for a deal that has been complicated by the player being in South America. Diaz is set to feature in Colombia's World Cup qualifier against Peru on Friday night, before travelling to Argentina for Tuesday's second qualifier. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Tottenham had been locked in talks with Porto over Diaz this week, with the Premier League club said to be willing to pay up to £46m, with £37.6m up front and £8.4m in performance-related add-ons. There was confidence from both sides that a deal could be reached before Liverpool reignited their interest. Transfer Centre LIVE! January transfer window: Done deals January window: Club-by-club deals Paper Talk Sky Sports News understands Tottenham feel like they did everything possible to secure the deal but the player simply prefers a move to Liverpool. Spurs are now working hard on other targets ahead of Monday's deadline. Diaz, who signed for Porto from Colombian side Junior in 2019, has 16 goals and six assists in 28 games for the Portuguese side this season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Missing out Luiz would be another big blow for Spurs this month, after the breakdown of the deal for Wolves winger Adama Traore, who now looks set to return to Barcelona on loan. Spurs want to make at least one signing this month, and according to Sky in Italy, they are also in talks to sign Morocco midfielder Sofyan Amrabat from Fiorentina on loan, with a €16m buy option being discussed. They could do more business if they are able to offload Dele Alli, Tanguy Ndombele or Giovani Lo Celso. Paris Saint-Germain are closing in on a deal to sign Ndombele on loan from Spurs, with an option to buy. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Portuguese football expert Filipe Dias on Transfer Talk: ""The newspapers in Portugal say the deal is going through, so it seems Luis Diaz, the best player in the Portuguese league, is going to be joining Liverpool. ""He is the kind player [Jurgen] Klopp likes, technically he is very gifted. He is bound for greater things than the Portuguese league. ""Diaz is the best Colombian player at the moment, the best player in Portugal at the moment, he can do anything up front despite not being a centre forward. ""He really has something special about him. There is no doubt in my mind that, if things go normally, he will fit in perfectly at Liverpool."" Sky Sports reporter Vinny O'Connor: ""Obviously, it's far from done and could easily come to nothing. ""However, Liverpool view this as an excellent deal if it gets completed - very much close to a Diogo Jota-type fee. Also, it is far better value than the original €60m asking price. ""Diaz was Jurgen Klopp's first choice for the summer, but they have brought those plans forward because it was clear if Liverpool didn't act this window, the player would move on. ""This isn't done and could yet collapse - the player is in South America with his national team, so it will be far from straightforward to complete the deal. ""However, if it does get done, it's a big coup for Julian Ward, who is to succeed sporting director Michael Edwards in the summer. It was a deal in which Ward lead for the first time, but it is fair to say he's been supported strongly by Edwards who put together the strategy to secure the player this month."" A quick glance at his headline stats in the Portuguese Primeira Liga this season suggests the 25-year-old provides serious goal threat - but also offers so much more. The winger ranks top for goals, shots and touches in the opposition box and is among the elite for winning back possession in the final third, creating chances, attempting fast breaks, aerials, dribbling and passes in the attacking third. The maps below narrow down his goal threat to Champions League appearances over the past two seasons and reveal Diaz is most potent from his favoured left channel, frequently carving chances for team-mates with diagonals into the box. Besides scoring goals, his most striking attribute is participation in overall play, with above-average numbers for passes in the final third - but the graphic below suggests Diaz also frequently tracks back to support the team. When visualising his goal and passing averages, Diaz emerges among an elite crop of players in Europe's top leagues, with returns on par with Karim Benzema and Mohamed Salah. His heat map below emphasises his work-rate with concentrations of activity in his defensive half, while his ability to reclaim possession high up the pitch would certainly suit a high-press style.

Winger Kulusevski joins on an 18-month loan deal that costs Spurs £8.3m - £2.5m this season and £5.8m next season - while there is an obligation to buy the Sweden international for £29.2m if certain sporting criteria are met.

The 21-year-old, who has three-and-a-half years remaining on his contract, has scored twice during the current campaign. Kulusevski's arrival has paved the way for Spurs winger Bryan Gil to join Valencia on loan until the end of the season. The Spaniard has made 20 appearances in all competitions this season but is yet to start a Premier League game and has not scored a goal. Spurs have also moved for Kulusevski's Juve team-mate Bentancur after they loaned out midfielders Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso on Deadline Day.

But if Pirlo, Totti and Maradona are comparisons from past eras, then Tottenham team-mate Hugo Lloris had a couple of modern-day equivalents for the evolving Kane. ""The way he plays, during the past few years, he drops more often and gives more space to the players around him,"" the Spurs skipper told Premier League Productions last month. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""In the way we play, under Antonio Conte, the number nine position is very important. It can demand the ball in space, but also has this interference to drop. Then, in one touches or two touches to change the game, from one side to the other side. ""I think this is the evolution of Harry. A little bit like Karim Benzema used to do or (Roberto) Firmino used to do. But that belongs to the best players."" Sky Sports' Adam Smith: The fact Kane finished top of the goal and assist charts last season epitomises the England striker's growing utility, while the graphic below highlights his potency: creating a league-high 14 assists from nearly half the number of chances created than the likes of Bruno Fernandes. Expected assists, a metric which measures the number of assists the average player would carve out from identical positions, predicts he should have created just shy of four - some 10 fewer than his total. This disparity suggests Kane has the ability to conjure something from nothing, and does it regularly. A slow start to this campaign after his failed move to Manchester City last summer skews his revival under Conte since November - but the goals and assists have flowed since the Italian arrived: his goal ratio has quadrupled and his assist returns have doubled. That assist for Heung-Min Son against Leeds was simply exquisite, and the passing masterclasses keep coming to complement his world-class finishing - prompting fans and pundits alike to draw comparisons with the world's all-time elite. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The debate about whether Kane has dropped too deep has raged for some time and the heat maps below clearly reveal the evolution of his role at Spurs - but the 28-year-old has certainly silenced the critics with league-topping numbers. ""It comes down to different managers, different ways of playing,"" Kane told Sky Sports after the home win over Everton last month. ""You see over the last few years, since (Jose) Mourinho, and now Conte, my game has changed a little bit, in terms of dropping into those pockets. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I played as a No 10 when I was a youth-team player, so I've always been used to playing that attacking-midfield role and I always back myself looking forward and passing forward."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The passing-range graphic below reveals the England captain has already notched four assists fired beyond 25 metres, with the assist at Leeds registering close to 50m - but distances alone fail to quantify the sheer pinpoint precision.  In terms of locations, the map below suggests Kane's most potent passes come from raking balls in centre-right areas, but he also switches play frequently, from one side of the opposition box to the other. While his passing is often pinpoint, his locations are far harder to nail down with passes across the width of the pitch, only notably taking up more central positions when in his own half. Meanwhile, his distribution directions reveal a primary intention to pass forwards, with a greater degree of accuracy when angling distribution to his right. Of course, it is hard to gauge the quality of passes on paper, but league-high returns for assists last season and a ratio of one assist every four league games under Conte this term, while functioning as the club's focal point up top, is nothing short of remarkable. Indeed, Kane ranks eighth in the Premier League for long-pass accuracy out of outfield players who have attempted 50 or more long balls this season - ahead of De Bruyne, who is widely considered the best passer in the division.

With Arsenal's loss at home to Brighton adding to earlier defeats for Wolves and Manchester United, Spurs had the chance to strengthen their grip on fourth and did so in emphatic style. Heung-Min Son's hat-trick helped to open up a three-point lead over the Gunners and Conte was thrilled by the mentality shown by his team as they withstood heavy pressure in the first half. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""A strong team needs character and personality to be strong mentally, because during a game you can have a period when you suffer because the opponent is pushing you a lot. ""Today, the first half was difficult but we knew this because when play at Aston Villa away in this stadium with this fantastic atmosphere I don't think there is one team that wins easy. ""For this reason, I was pleased with attitude of the players, the composure. They decided to stay strong. And then in the second half, I think we won the game in an important way. ""For sure, we have to be more good when there is this type of pressure and try to continue to play. Because every time we had the ball we had chances to score. Son hat-trick as Spurs thrash Villa Tottenham's remaining fixtures How the teams lined up Match stats ""If you have an opposition who plays with high pressure, the space will open to attack. In the second half, we were much better I think because the intensity of Aston Villa was slower. ""It was a great win for us. Especially when you play a game after your rivals for a place in the Champions League - Wolverhampton, Manchester United and Arsenal - have lost. ""In this moment you start to feel the blood. It is important in this moment not to fail. We are working a lot on the mentality and the players are giving me satisfaction. ""For sure, to see this improvement makes me proud. It gives me great satisfaction. At the same time, I know we have to work on this improvement. ""Because there is not only the tactical, technical and physical aspects but there is the mentality. There is a lot of space for improvement. But today they showed me they have improved this aspect."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Heung-Min Son now has 17 Premier League goals this season and in this form might yet rival Mohamed Salah for the golden boot. That connection with Harry Kane looks as lethal as ever, with the England captain's assist for the third goal highlighting his extraordinary vision. But perhaps it is time we talked about this being a magical trio at Tottenham as well as a perfect partnership. Dejan Kulusevski raced through to score from another Kane assist and then turned provider for Son for the fourth goal. The Swede has been a revelation since his arrival. There is not much that Kane and Son lacked but he has added it. A natural left-footer, he knows when to slow the game down as well as speed it up, and that calmness in the final third sets him apart from the other contenders for that third position in the Tottenham attack. Gareth Bale's return to the club on loan from Real Madrid last season had briefly hinted at a dream team of a forward line - and the Welshman did deliver goals. But Kulusevski has been better. This time, it looks like it might be enough to carry Spurs into the Champions League places. Asked if Tottenham had the best front three in the Premier League, Aston Villa boss Steven Gerrard was complimentary but stopped short of agreeing. ""They are certainly high-level players. I'd say two of them are world-class and I think the young kid from Juventus, Kulusevski, is potentially a top player. ""That's my opinion on it, but I think you have to remember that there's City and Liverpool and Chelsea who've all got world-class players as well. ""So I'm not sure where Tottenham sit in the league, but normally the team that wins the league has the best forward line."" Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

Anthony Gordon boosted Everton's chances of Premier League survival as his first-half strike proved the difference in a scrappy affair against United. Gordon's deflected effort before the half-hour alleviated the pressure on Frank Lampard after a 3-2 midweek defeat at relegation rivals Burnley had left Everton just a solitary point above the drop zone. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player This was far from a vintage display from either side but a 1-0 win for the Toffees puts daylight between themselves and the bottom three as United's top-four ambitions suffered another untimely dent. Rangnick's men sit seventh in the table, three points off fourth-placed Tottenham having played one game more, while Arsenal are in fifth placed with two games in hand over United. ""If you don't score a single goal in 95 minutes we have to be disappointed. We had a good start and should have created more chances out of that domination. Then we concede a deflected shot and lost a bit of our composure. ""The second half we were trying to add creativity with substitutions but we didn't always take the right decision. Get Sky Sports Premier League table Premier League results Watch Premier League highlights Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We had to do something. We needed a goal and we decided to bring Mata and more verticality with Elanga. They were defending with their players in the last 35 minutes. We didn't find the right player at the right moment. We didn't have enough players in the box when we played crosses."" ""It's not only creativity. I think we had enough creative players on the pitch. It's also about being physical enough in the final third, being physical and trying to score a goal. We didn't have enough players in the box."" On United's top-four hopes, he added: ""It's difficult. As long as we don't win our own games it doesn't make sense to hope for good results from the other teams. ""Fred had some muscular problems on his hip flexor. We already are without McTominay. Without both defensive midfielders it isn't good for us."" Rangnick made half a dozen changes from the side that drew 1-1 against Leicester last week - Lampard himself made four - as Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcus Rashford were restored to the starting XI. The bustling Rashford was thwarted twice early on by Jordan Pickford but Ronaldo was largely subdued as United remain cut adrift from the Champions League places after being downed by Gordon's shot, which thudded into visiting captain Harry Maguire and left goalkeeper David De Gea stranded. Everton, up until that point, were lacking in inspiration but they noticeably grew in stature after going ahead, when the mood around Goodison Park dramatically changed, although they were given relatively few scares by a United side that have won just one of their last five top-flight fixtures. Despite coming off in the 64th minute, Marcus Rashford attempted more shots at goal (3) and had more touches in the opposition's box (6) than any other player in the match. It is scant consolation for the disgruntled travelling fans but it is something that Rangnick can take with him back to Manchester. The United interim boss continued: ""We had a good start to the game in the first 25 minutes, we were in full control. Saying that, we didn't create enough advantage from this period, especially on the left side. We had our moments and could've scored despite me wishing for us to be more penetrating. ""You could literally feel they were crumbling after the defeat against Burnley but we couldn't take advantage. In the second half, they defended with all their players on the pitch and weren't able to break that wall down."" ""There's no point looking at the table when you perform like that. It's difficult to say why as our training sessions were aggressive and the signs were there. We didn't pin them back and this is also one of our problems right now as we don't win the balls to then create the chances. ""I don't see any connection [when asked if Erik ten Hag talk is a distraction]. I don't see any connection between this issue or this excuse. A new manager is coming soon. It doesn't matter if it is announced in five days, 15 days or 20 days. All the players want to play at the highest level, in the Champions League, but if we play as we did today then we don't deserve it. ""The players shouldn't struggle with the expectation at this club. You have to score the first goal in a game like this. We have to help the team to find better solutions. We had four strikers on the pitch for the first 60 minutes and played like we did. We need to be more penetrative but in total we just didn't have enough players in the box."" Given both teams are low on confidence, it was perhaps little surprise that it was a cagey opening few minutes, complete with stray passes and the sides loose in possession, although Everton were particularly hesitant, with United getting on top and having two early sights at goal through Rashford. The hitherto out-of-form forward was lively on the left and had a snap shot parried away by the outstretched Pickford, who moments later excellently got down low to deny a header from the England forward as Gordon snuffed out any danger on the rebound. Everton appeared listless and lethargic, with their fans growing restless, but the atmosphere and momentum changed as they took a 27th-minute lead following some sluggishness at the back from United. ""I've got to give the lads a lot of credit here having lost twice in a week,"" Lampard said. ""To go again Saturday morning against a team that's fresh and full of quality was excellent. It was joined-up with the fans, it's been good here since I've arrived by that's not a given. The players put the effort in. We've been due one of those, a deflection, something to hang onto. ""I'm pleased for Anthony. He feels it, he's grown up here and he's mature beyond his age. No wonder the fans love him. It's always a team effort and Jordan made two big saves in the first half and an outstanding one at the end. It felt outstanding. His quality makes the save. Jordan is England's No 1 for a reason and he absolutely showed it today."" Lampard pumped his fist on the touchline, and no doubt breathed a sigh of relief, following a momentous win - just the third in his tenure in the league in 10 attempts. ""We know it's in our hands, regardless of the others, to stay in the league. Some people around me have been calculating how many more points or wins we need but I'm not focused on that. We just need to keep performing like this.""

We have lots of international players. There shouldn't be an alibi. There will be a new manager next season. If this is announced now or in 10 days it shouldn't have an impact."" Sky Sports' Ben Grounds at Goodison Park. This high-stakes clash was the polar opposite to the encounter between Liverpool and Manchester's other club this weekend. Man City vs Liverpool represents a meeting of two of the game's greatest minds, a masterpiece between the league's title protagonists in a class of their own. By contrast, Goodison Park hosted a festival of the doomed involving two clubs in desperate need of a reset. But Everton are not dead. This was a step in the right direction. It was this month three years ago that they produced arguably their best performance of the Farhad Moshiri era against Manchester United, outclassing them 4-0 to provoke a memorable rebuke from Gary Neville. The defeat exposed all the problems facing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. A fifth successive away defeat for the first time since 1981 would contribute to their failure to qualify for the Champions League. ""I've often said that clubs over the last seven years, if you've got weeds in the garden, then you've got to get rid of them,"" said Neville. ""But there's some Japanese knotweed at that football club and it's attacking the foundations of the house. It needs dealing with properly.""

Alexandre Lacazette is under mounting scrutiny. The Frenchman has only scored once in his last 11 Premier League appearances and his tally for the season stands at just four goals in 25 games. He has not had a shot on target since mid-March. He has not found the net from open play since December. Until recently, his lack of goal threat was mitigated by other qualities. Between December 6 and March 13, Lacazette registered two more assists (seven) than any other Premier League player. His contribution, dropping deep to link the play and feed runners either side of him, was integral to the upturn in form which followed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's banishment from the side and propelled Arsenal back into the Champions League race. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""Laca has a really important quality, which is that he makes the people around him better,"" said Mikel Arteta in conversation with Sky Sports ahead of Arsenal's 3-2 win over Watford last month. His performance at Vicarage Road showed exactly what Arteta was talking about. Lacazette may not have scored himself but he played a crucial role in the victory nonetheless, teeing up Bukayo Saka for Arsenal's second then setting up Gabriel Martinelli's third. ""It's so fun to play with him,"" said Saka afterwards. Fellow academy graduate Emile Smith Rowe has been similarly complimentary. ""Playing with him up top really helps me,"" he said last season. ""He gives me a lot of confidence and talks to me a lot."" Arsenal's fixtures Premier League table Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Arsenal followed up their win at Watford with a 2-0 victory over Leicester which included a Lacazette goal from the penalty spot. Since then, however, they have lost three games out of four and the man tasked with leading the line has struggled more than anyone. Lacazette's lack of potency in front of goal was excusable when he was helping others thrive, but not anymore. Against Brighton, as well as failing to register a shot on goal, he had fewer touches (22) and made fewer passes (eight) than any other starter. For many supporters, patience was already running out. Lacazette's anonymous showing against Brighton followed similarly poor displays against Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and Liverpool. He has gone from averaging 2.8 shots per 90 minutes to just 1.6 and he is creating barely half as many chances. His numbers for touches and passes have dropped by roughly a third. On top of that, he is offering even less of a presence in the opposition box. Lacazette's willingness to drop into midfield flummoxed opponents initially, but it looks increasingly like they have figured him out. Patrick Vieira even mentioned him by name after masterminding Crystal Palace's 3-0 win over the Gunners at Selhurst Park. ""Any time they managed to find players [between the lines], we always had one of our back four who jumped out and try to put pressure, especially on Alexandre Lacazette,"" he said. Brighton employed similar tactics on Saturday and so too did Liverpool and Aston Villa before that. Lacazette is still dropping deep but he is no longer finding the same space to operate. Arsenal's attacking fluency is suffering as a result. Fatigue appears to be another factor. Arteta has frequently talked up Lacazette's ""phenomenal"" off-the-ball work-rate but his lethargic performances of late suggest the endeavours of the last few months are catching up with him. So too does the tracking data. Before his recent dip in form, Lacazette had covered more than 10km in each of the last four games in which he had played the full 90 minutes. In each of the last two, however, against Brighton and Crystal Palace, he has fallen short of that milestone. It is perhaps unsurprising that a player who turns 31 next month is tiring, especially given the dramatic increase in his workload. Since Aubameyang was dropped, Lacazette has started 16 consecutive games. It is by far his longest run of starts since joining Arsenal. Many supporters are eager to see something different as Arsenal attempt to get their top-four challenge back on track, but the situation is complicated by a lack of clear alternatives. The club intend to sign at least one striker in the summer - ""any successful team needs enough goal threat in the squad,"" Arteta told Sky Sports in March - but until then their options beyond Lacazette are limited to Eddie Nketiah, who has not started a Premier League game all season, or the redeployment of a supporting forward such as Martinelli or Smith Rowe. Those who disagreed with the decision to let Aubameyang go will take his explosive start to life at Barcelona as vindication. Others will rue the decision not to replace him in the same transfer window. Arteta, though, must do what he can with what he has. Dropping Lacazette would be another gamble, given the relative inexperience of his alternatives, but the team already requires recalibration following the injuries to Kieran Tierney and Thomas Partey. Why not reassess his attacking set-up at the same time? Lacazette's listless display against Brighton showed the need for change up front is becoming increasingly urgent. Recent evidence suggests Arteta cannot put it off for much longer. Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6. Play for free, entries by 3pm ",positive,liverpool,2

The Arsenal boss had called for a reaction from his side after Monday's 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace but a 2-1 loss at home to Brighton saw them miss the chance to move up to fourth again. Later on Saturday, rivals Tottenham moved three points clear in the final Champions League qualifying spot with a 4-0 win at Aston Villa. The Gunners were once again below-par in the opening 45 minutes, trailing to Leandro Trossard's strike, and fell further behind after the break to Enock Mwepu's half-volley. It wasn't until Martin Odegaard's long-range deflected strike pulled one back in the 89th minute that Arsenal really stepped up the intensity but, as Arteta conceded, by then it was too late. Afterwards, he criticised his side's lack of reaction to Monday night and their inability to impose themselves on the match, particularly in the first half. ""The first half was really poor again,"" he said. ""The reaction that we wanted to show and everything we talked about we didn't make it happen on the pitch. ""We were sloppy with the ball, we were second best in a lot of situations, we didn't show any purpose or build any momentum in the game, we didn't play with the right speed and transform the game Brighton proposed today and the first chance - the only chance they had - they scored a goal.

We didn't have that intention to attack and step in and provoke the situation we wanted to. We were looking at each other too many times instead of taking ownership and doing what we have to do. You can't play like that."" It was another ineffective performance from striker Alexandre Lacazette, who has failed to have a shot on target in any of the last four games, but Arteta insisted the Gunners' attacking problems were a ""collective issue"". However, he accepted the tactical change he'd made for the match, with Emile Smith Rowe in a slightly deeper role and the decision to field Granit Xhaka at left-back and drop the out-of-form Nuno Tavares hadn't worked as he'd hoped. ""The spaces we wanted to attack, it fitted Emile to play that position and because we thought the space would be there for Granit to use, which it was. But we didn't use it."" That change had been forced by an injury to Kieran Tierney, while Thomas Partey's absence in midfield is adding to Arteta's problems. With Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham to come in three of their next four games, Arsenal have a lot of work to do to make the Champions League spots, after looking favourites to finish in the top four a few weeks ago. Discussing the task ahead, Arteta said: ""With all the team available we knew how difficult the challenge was. Those two injuries make the situation more complicated. But we can't look at that because we can't be looking for excuses. What happened today is down to us, the players we have and the way we prepared the game.

We criticise ourselves a lot because we deserved to [lose] because we were really poor first half and lift ourselves up. ""We know this road is taking us nowhere, especially where we want to be. We have everything to play for in the last eight games. We have to have that level of energy and visualise the beautiful challenge we have ahead, don't sit back and let's see what happens."" Goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale admitted he was frustrated by Arsenal's inability to play with freedom, adding the performance was simply ""not good enough"". ""This was supposed to be the reaction game but it wasn't,"" he told Arsenal's official website. ""We've lost and not managed to pick up any points and next week is even bigger. I think we just need to go out there and be free and play our game, you know? ""It's a game of football and I think in the first half we were very tense and slow, so we just need to go out there next week, trust what the manager and the coaching staff are saying and go and play our football, which we've done all season. ""It's not good enough. Two games on the spin where the first 45 minutes has got away from us. You make it an uphill battle against any team in the Premier League if you're losing at half-time."" Sky Sports' Peter Smith: Only a couple of weeks ago it felt as though Arsenal were favourites to land fourth place and a long-awaited return to the Champions League. But in the space of six days their hopes of returning to Europe's top club competition have suffered a significant blow. The defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday Night Football was a bad one. Arsenal, harassed and harried by their London rivals, never got going and made costly mistakes. It was the worst performance they'd served up since the early weeks of the season. A young side is prone to inconsistency, though, and the real issue was not that loss but how they'd respond. The answer Arsenal fans saw on Saturday would have alarmed them. While Brighton didn't bring the same frantic pressing style to the Emirates that Palace showed at Selhurst Park, Arsenal were still slow out of the blocks again, sloppy in possession and disjointed in attack, with the forced reshuffle caused by Thomas Partey's absence and Nuno Tavares' form not working. Gabriel Martinelli was denied an equaliser by a marginal offside call on the stroke of half time but that would have been harsh on Brighton. It wasn't until Martin Odegaard made it 2-1 in the 89th minute that Arsenal showed the required intensity levels. With injuries, fixtures and points totals now counting against them, Arsenal have it all to do if they are to overhaul neighbours Tottenham in the race for fourth. Come the summer, they may look back on this week as the moment their encouraging season unravelled.

Defeat in Europe means the earliest United can achieve silverware is by winning next season's League Cup final, which is due to take place on February 26, 2023. With 2017 the last time United won a major trophy, they are now on their longest drought in four decades. After victory in the 1977 FA Cup, they had to wait until 1983 for their next triumph when they won the competition again. United's win rate of 45 per cent in all competitions this season is their lowest since 1989-90. Since former manager Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, United have lifted just three pieces of silverware. The FA Cup under Louis van Gaal in 2016, and the League Cup and Europa League under Jose Mourinho the following year. After the high-profile arrivals of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho last summer, United were expected to mount a serious challenge for trophies this season, but they quickly fell behind rivals Manchester City and Liverpool in the Premier League and now face an uphill struggle to finish in the top four. In a campaign that has seen former player Ole Gunnar Solskjaer lose his job as manager and Ralf Rangnick become interim boss, United crashed out of both domestic cup competitions with home losses to West Ham in September and Middlesbrough last month. Man Utd fixtures Champions League Find out more about Sky Sports Get Sky Sports Their remaining hope was the Champions League, but defeat by Atletico Madrid in the last 16 sees their trophy drought extend into a sixth consecutive season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports' Dan Sansom: May 24, 2017. The last time Manchester United won a major trophy. April 22, 2013. The last time Manchester United won the Premier League. Under Sir Alex Ferguson, United never went more than three seasons without winning the Premier League title. For those who grew up knowing nothing else but endless success under the Scot, it is understandable to view the current run of nine years following his retirement as a catastrophe. But for a club and institution the size of United, that's exactly what it is. Since his departure, United have lifted just three major trophies in nine seasons. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was tasked with restoring United to former glories when he replaced Jose Mourinho in 2018, but a mammoth penalty shootout loss to Villarreal in last season's Europa League final was the closest he came before eventually being sacked later that year. Attention then turned to interim boss Ralf Rangnick, but a shock FA Cup defeat by Middlesbrough ended United's best chance of winning silverware in what has been - to put it mildly - a disastrous 2021/22 campaign. It is now half a decade since United last won a major trophy - their longest drought in 40 years. Liverpool waited 30 years for a top-flight title. It will already be 10 if United fall short in the league next season and although it might be a stretch to suggest they are on the same path, history has a strange way of repeating itself. On current evidence, United's barren streak looks set to continue for a while yet. How have Manchester United performed since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013?

United held official talks with the 52-year-old last week which were billed as ""very positive"", and Sky Sports News understands that a process of due diligence has followed over what it would entail should they choose to hire him. Ajax granted permission for the formal discussion to take place and have not been obstructive to the process. Sources close to Ten Hag and the Dutch club have suggested that dialogue has taken place over the financial element as well as how to handle a possible announcement - should the process progress that way - in terms of timing and presentation, given Ajax are in a tight title race. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player However, United insist this is premature, and no formal enquiry has been put forward in that regard. They have made it very clear that they do not have a preferred candidate yet to take charge next season, and are simply following a rigorous process to settle on the right man. Ascertaining compensation figures and ease of appointment will be done with all candidates. The club feels it is unfair to portray Ten Hag as the frontrunner for the position when they are still working through their shortlist. Mauricio Pochettino and Luis Enrique are also under consideration, while Julen Lopetegui seemingly ruled himself out of contention by saying: ""I am where I want to be.

Paris Saint-Germain, meanwhile, will part company with Pochettino on their terms and not that of another club. It has been reported they would have to fork out between £15m to £20m if they sack the Argentine and his staff, an outlay that would be saved if he was offered and accepted another job. Pochettino and Ten Hag have long been considered the favoured options for the job, a line of reporting that hasn't been discouraged by United.

The race for Champions League football was Arsenal's to lose. But as the Premier League enters its final six-week period, suddenly the picture looks very different. Two defeats in three Premier League games, including Monday night's horrific 3-0 defeat away at Crystal Palace leaves Mikel Arteta's side facing a real fight to get back into the top four. Now it's the Gunners' arch-rivals Tottenham - who are in form after three wins on the bounce - holding the coveted fourth spot which earns a seat at European football's top table next season. Arsenal do have the slight luxury of a game in hand over Spurs, though the task of going away to Chelsea later this month needing a win feels a lot less comfortable. That crucial match at Stamford Bridge on April 20 marks the beginning of a tricky run for the Gunners, with a home clash against Manchester United swiftly following that game in hand, before a trip to West Ham at the start of May. It has transformed Arsenal's next two matches - at home to Brighton and away at Southampton - into simply must-win fixtures. But the pressure, scrutiny and injury problems are beginning to mount, so how have the Gunners got into this sticky scenario? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Monday evening's poor outing at Crystal Palace was a shock in terms of the formbook - but a closer look at Arsenal's recent performances implies this type of result was coming. Arsenal's fixtures Latest Arsenal news Premier League table Get Sky Sports Arteta's side failed to get going in a tough Selhurst Park atmosphere, with their first shot on target coming in the final kick of the opening half. Clinical finishing, particularly from open play, has been a concern for the Gunners in recent weeks. Their troubles are highlighted by the fact they have failed to score a single goal from non-set piece scenarios in their last four matches, dating back to March 6. Arsenal have averaged just 3.75 shots on target per game in their last four Premier League matches, so they are not making massive strides to actually test the opposition goalkeeper. This is despite them creating 52 overall shots in that period - only Tottenham and Brighton have managed more. This poor finishing was as clear as day against Palace. Within the space of a few second-half minutes, Emile Smith Rowe and Martin Odegaard missed clear-cut chances to haul Arsenal back into the contest at 2-0 down. The Eagles made them pay by adding a third through Wilfried Zaha's goal shortly afterwards. Arsenal have been guilty of making similar errors in the past. In one of their games in hand against Liverpool last month, Odegaard missed a glorious chance to give the Gunners the lead from Thiago's loose backpass - but failed to convert past goalkeeper Alisson. Minutes later, Diogo Jota gave Liverpool the lead and Jurgen Klopp's side ran out eventual 2-0 winners. And against Manchester City on New Year's Day, Gabriel Martinelli missed a major chance with the scores at 1-1. The importance of that missed opportunity grew in significance when Rodri scored in stoppage time to give City the win. Similar concerns were raised during Arsenal's 0-0 draw against Burnley, where Arteta's side failed to score from 75 per cent possession and 20 shots on goal. While this lack of profligacy can be put down to individual errors, it can be correlated to a lack of firepower up front. Arsenal failed to bring in a replacement for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the January transfer window, leaving just Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah as their only recognised forwards. Lacazette has shown this season that he can bring separate skills other than scoring goals in the centre-forward role. In the 10 league games after Aubameyang was stripped of the Gunners captaincy before his departure from the club, he netted three goals and added seven assists for Arteta's squad. But the Frenchman has mustered just four league goals this season, and half of them have come from the penalty spot. Arsenal are struggling to score goal-scoring chances and they do not have the central option to create chances from nothing - there remains a reliance on wide options top scorers Bukayo Saka and Smith Rowe - both aged 21 and under -- for attacking influence. Compare Arsenal's plight to Tottenham's flight in front of goal. No team has made more shots - either on or off target - than Antonio Conte's side since Arsenal last scored from open goal. Data also shows Spurs are creating better chances in front of goal in that same period. This attacking impetus shows why Spurs are threatening to steal a march on the top-four race - and why the north London pendulum is swinging again. To make matters worse for Arsenal, their injury issues are piling up during this crucial part of the season. The build-up to their Crystal Palace defeat on Monday was marred by an injury to left-back Kieran Tierney, with Arteta describing the setback as ""not positive"" with regards to the Scotland international returning in time for the season run-in. It meant 22-year-old full-back Nuno Tavares was drafted in as Tierney's replacement for just his seventh league start of the season, and his lack of minutes clearly showed as he was partly at fault for the Eagles' two first-half goals. Tavares was beaten at the back post by Joachim Andersen for Jean-Philippe Mateta's opener, while his inability to track Jordan Ayew's run allowed the Ghanaian to double Palace's advantage. He was hauled off at half-time by Arteta, who branded the decision as ""tactical"". The Portuguese full-back has endured some tough outings in an Arsenal shirt in recent months, particularly away from home. He showed similar levels of sloppiness in the defeat away at Everton in December, before being taken off after just 35 minutes for tactical reasons in the FA Cup loss at Nottingham Forest. The statistics show that while Tierney and Tavares' statistics are similar, the latter is sloppier defensively than the Scot, who will be a big miss should he be out for the rest of the season. Arsenal do have other options in that left-back role, including Cedric Soares and Granit Xhaka - but both were used in that role this time last year, and the Gunners' season fell apart. Arteta cannot risk that happening again, so a quick-fire solution is needed. In additional salt to the Gunners' wounds, Thomas Partey limped off after pulling a muscle in the build-up to Palace's third goal, with Arsenal's No 5 expected to be another significant absentee. The Ghana midfielder's absence at the start of this calendar year, due to Africa Cup of Nations duty and suspension, was another bleak period for the Gunners. In the four matches Partey missed in January, Arsenal failed to score a goal in that time. It was only when the midfielder emerged back again in the team in February Arteta's side started winning again. The latest Gunners injuries mean Arteta's thin, young squad - which was manufactured in that way as there was no European football to contend with this season - is now incredibly short. The substitutes' bench at Palace contained three academy products without a single minute of first-team action this season. The inexperience on the bench is likely to reappear between now and the end of May. ""It's what we have, it's the numbers that we have,"" Arteta said immediately after the Palace defeat. ""We've lost Kieran and we've lost Thomas now and that's it. ""With the players that we have we will keep trying like we have since the start of the season, but we never had a big squad so we can't find any excuses. Today we have to look at ourselves and I'm the first one because I repeat myself, it wasn't good enough."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Again, Arsenal's injury woes compare strikingly to Tottenham's fitness issues. Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son have appeared to avoid their annual 'winter injuries', while Cristian Romero and Eric Dier have returned from the sidelines in time for the run-in. It's not just good luck that has fallen Spurs' way. The white half of north London were more proactive in the January transfer market, bringing in Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski who have made Tottenham more ""complete"", according to Conte. Arsenal, on the other hand, stubbornly chose to not bring in anyone, including a centre-forward. Those January decisions could be crucial when determining which north London postcode hosts Champions League football next term. Challenging for Champions League has not been an ambition at the Emirates Stadium in the past two seasons, but Arteta may look at the last time Arsenal were involved in this race with concern. The 2018/19 season saw Unai Emery's Gunners lie on the brink of a top-four finish, with the club sitting in third spot in April of that season with just a handful of matches to go. But a horrendous run-in saw it all go awry - and a defeat to Palace started the end of season collapse. The 3-2 home loss to the Eagles in April was the start of a run of three straight league defeats for Arsenal, who then suddenly dropped out of the top four. A 1-1 home draw to Brighton - and a Europa League final loss to Chelsea saw those ambitions vanish for that season. Brighton, coincidentally, are Arsenal's opponents this weekend, with the Seagulls suffering from similar issues themselves. They have scored just one Premier League goal since February 12 - and failed to find the net from 29 shots on goal in their goalless draw with Norwich on Saturday. Win and the pressure mounts on Tottenham ahead of their Saturday Night Football clash at Aston Villa, live on Sky Sports. But another slip-up and the tensions that currently exist could mount again, and it could lead to troublesome consequences in their top-four battle.

The Gunners' top-four hopes took a significant dent at Palace, a result which leaves Tottenham in fourth place after the Premier League weekend. The Gunners do have a game in hand on their north London rivals but this was an out-of-character performance from Arteta's side, as first-half goals from Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew and a second-half Wilfried Zaha penalty handed fantastic Palace the points. Arteta, who was missing left-back Kieran Tierney with a knee injury picked up with Scotland after playing in both of their recent friendlies, criticised his team's performance, admitting they did not compete physically with Palace. He told Sky Sports: ""Congratulations to Palace for the game they played but we made it impossible for ourselves with the way we competed. ""You have to be physical and run and then you earn the right to play. We were really inconsistent on the ball and that is unacceptable. ""We were poor, especially in the first half. I apologise to our supporters. We didn't have the presence today or the composure to dominate the situation so that is what I'm most annoyed with. Some days you are not there and you are late all the time. They got on top of it and had a good atmosphere and we could not get out.

""We have to face the challenge and the opportunity is in our hands. We have to be honest with ourselves and support each other. ""From the beginning we were not at the races. When you come here you have to compete, you have to win duels and second balls and be aggressive and we were none of those and on top of that we were really poor on the ball. ""We tried in the second half, we had three or four big chances but the only half chance they had they got a penalty. ""It is time to accept the criticism, put your hand up and apologise because this performance was not good enough for this club, and then react. When everything goes well everyone wants to be there and be supportive."" Arteta was asked if perhaps one of the reasons for the defeat was the pressure being applied to them by Tottenham in the top-four race. He replied: ""No, the pressure has been there the last seven or eight weeks. Today we didn't perform it's as simple as that. We were second best in every department it's as simple as that. We have a game in hand still. In the nine games a lot will happen. We have to focus on ourselves."" On Tierney's injury, Arteta admitted the situation did not look positive for the Scotland full-back. ""He came back from international duty and he felt something wrong in his knee,"" Arteta said. ""We scanned it and there is some damage there. ""He's seeing the specialist on Tuesday and hopefully we will know more but it's not looking good.""

""They've got a lot of important games coming up and they're in pole position still. I just think they've got so many young players that this might hurt them. Tottenham have got a little bit more experience which could help them get over the line."" Jamie Carragher on Monday Night Football: ""It's a bad night for Arsenal - the way they've lost, not just the three points but I think it's very important they don't panic and there's no hysteria. They're still in a really good position - a better position than Tottenham and Manchester United. ""They've just won five games away from home on the bounce so you're talking about 15 points from 18 away from home. They'd have took that from the six games away from home. ""It was a bad one and the worry is that this could happen another two or three times. Other teams will take encouragement from the way Palace played.

Ahead of United's Premier League clash against Leicester City, live on Sky Sports, the Portuguese midfielder was handed a new four-year contract at Old Trafford, with the option of a further year. The improved terms come with the club still employing Ralf Rangnick as an interim manager while Ajax manager Erik Ten Hag has been interviewed for a permanent role from the summer. With confusion over who is helping to recruit new players at United as well, Merson has strongly criticised the decision to make big investments on players, without knowing whether the likes of Ten Hag or PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino - who has also been linked with the role - will like them. ""I'm flabbergasted,"" Merson told Soccer Saturday. ""You give him a four-year contract extension with more money, but a manager could come in and he might not like him. He may not like the throwing the hands up in the air and moaning when not getting the ball. It might be Ten Hag who might want someone else.

Unless they've got a manager sorted - and I doubt it - and they said 'do you want Fernandes? We'll sign him up'. ""You have to like that kind of player. He's a bit of a luxury player as he's going to make things happen. But Ten Hag could come in and play a certain way of football. I'm shocked, it's a bit of a shambles. Man Utd fixtures Latest Man Utd news Premier League table Get Sky Sports ""I'm not saying he's not a good player, he's a good player. But everyone's different. Jack Grealish is a great player, but would Jurgen Klopp have paid £100m for him? It's horses for courses and a manager could come in and say that Fernandes is not my cup of tea."" Fernandes was the club's standout player during his first 18 months at Old Trafford, and has won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award twice The 27-year-old has made 117 appearances for United and scored 49 goals in all competitions since moving from Sporting. He also scored both goals for Portugal in midweek to secure his country's place at the 2022 World Cup, beating North Macedonia 2-0 in their play-off. United football director John Murtough added: ""Everyone is well aware of Bruno's importance to Manchester United. His goals and assists record is phenomenal and he has performed remarkably consistently since he joined the club. ""Bruno's work-rate, dedication and fantastic attitude are exactly what we want from a Manchester United player. He is the ultimate professional with many fantastic attributes to drive the high standards required to play for this great club. ""Bruno, like everyone across the football club, remains hugely ambitious and determined to deliver sustained success on the pitch to get us back to challenging for titles."" Analysis from Sky Sports News senior reporter Melissa Reddy: Of all the matters Manchester United need to work through, tying down Bruno Fernandes on a new contract with improved terms would be far down the list. The player's previous deal had three years to run with the option of a further 12 months, and the development purely revolves around financially rewarding him for his influence under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and underlining his status in the squad. It will be one less thing to tick off on United's long to-do list, but it was not pressing. With the identity of the next permanent manager still unknown - whether he would see Fernandes as core as the new contract would reflect will be intriguing given the midfielder's drop in form - and so many big question marks around the squad, the timing is odd. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  While progress is being made on the dugout front, with Erik ten Hag formally interviewed over taking charge of the club, United need to have more certainty in place over the make-up of the team. The attack and midfield need surgery, with the acceptance from the recruitment group that adding the right striker and anchor in the centre of the park is imperative. Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard, Edinson Cavani and Juan Mata may leave in the summer, while Marcus Rashford's future is uncertain. The England international's performances have been well below par, but while he can point to being played through injury as a semi-defence, Fernandes, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire have also been levels below expectation. What happens with loaned-out pair Anthony Martial and Donny van de Beek? Or Dean Henderson, Eric Bailly and Nemanja Matic? Then there is the Cristiano Ronaldo conundrum, as well as a clutch of deals that expire next summer. When held up against the greater scheme of things, the Fernandes development is a small one. Manchester United are suffering a tumultuous campaign after a second-place Premier League finish last season morphed into a severe decline in form - culminating with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer losing his job in November last year. Fernandes arrived at Old Trafford with a fanfare in January, 2020 and immediately delivered with league-topping attacking returns and talismanic displays - instantly making him the man United turned to. When factoring in the team's overall dip this season, Fernandes has, arguably, continued to perform with 15 goal involvements in the Premier League - only five players in the division have more - and creating a league-high 66 chances from open play. Broken down, only Cristiano Ronaldo has scored more goals and Paul Pogba has carved more assists at United. The 27-year-old has made more touches and passes in the final third than any player at the club and regained possession in the final third a team-topping 23 times. Has the team's dip affected Fernandes, or has his dip affected the team? The question alone underlines his importance and his returns remain impressive during a troubled season - and a new five-year contract suggests the hierarchy agrees.

United are keen to sign a winger during this transfer window and, while their first choice is Sancho, Dembele represents a strong alternative. The 23-year-old was a club-record signing for Barcelona when he arrived from Borussia Dortmund for €105m (£95.75m) in August 2017. He has won two La Liga titles and the Copa del Rey during his three seasons in Spain, but has been restricted to 75 appearances in all competitions by a series of injuries. The France international is one of four alternative options United are working on if they are unable to sign Sancho, along with Watford's Ismaila Sarr, Real Madrid's Luka Jovic and free agent Edinson Cavani. On Tuesday, United had a bid for Sancho worth up to £91.3m (€100m) rejected by Borussia Dortmund. The offer was for an initial £73m, rising to up to £91.3m, which fell short of Dortmund's £108m valuation. United are now considering whether to return with an improved bid for the England international. Transfer Centre LIVE! The making of Van de Beek Man Utd transfer rumours Man Utd's £91.3m Sancho bid rejected Dortmund set United a deadline of August 10 to agree a deal for Sancho, and have stated on several occasions the winger will not be leaving now that date has passed. Sancho has not travelled with the rest of the Dortmund squad for the German Super Cup match against Bayern Munich on Wednesday due to a ""respiratory infection"". He has tested negative for Covid-19.

The 22-year-old was the subject of a loan offer from Leeds last week and, while he wants to stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford, the arrival of another winger could lead to a reassessment of his future at the club.

He went on to say that while he is there, he will count on Dembele. ""It appears Barca seem much more open to do business on Dembele than Dortmund are with Sancho. It's definitely one to watch because it seems with what Koeman is saying, that he hasn't ruled out Demebele leaving the Nou Camp. ""It is thought United are working on at least four alternatives to Sancho... While Cavani and Jovic aren't seen as like-for-like replacements, I think Manchester United's priority is to strengthen the depth of that forward line. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""With Cavani, Man United would have to take into account his wages and his age - he's 33 years old - and also the length of the contract he would want at this stage of his career. As for Jovic, the Real Madrid boss Zineidne Zidane won't rule out a departure. There are reports coming from Italy that he's been offered to Roma. ""Then there is Sarr. If Manchester United fail to get Sancho, Cavani or Jovic, all is not lost because they can still buy Sarr until the domestic deadline on October 16 because Premier League clubs and EFL clubs can still do business after October 5 so they have another 11 days to maybe get a deal done. ""Manchester United's interest in Sarr can almost take a back seat, they can use it as a watching brief just now, unless someone else comes in for him, of course."" Former Manchester United assistant manager Steve McClaren has told Sky Sports News he thinks Dembele would only be a short-term option for his former club, until they are able to sign Sancho. McClaren encouraged United to meet Dortmund's asking price for Sancho, and also wants them to upgrade their defence, saying: ""They need a centre-forward, they need a centre-back and they need a left-back. Those are the priorities. ""But players like Sancho don't come around very often. He's a unique type of player to go into Manchester United. They've been searching all across the world. They're only £20m short - come on, get the deal done! It's for the future. ""United have done well so far with their scouting and who they have brought in. If they're still going for Sancho, then I think Dembele is for the short-term, a stopgap. ""But they need a centre-forward, and they need a centre-back. If they want to play with intensity and a high line, they need speed at the back."" Sky Sports' Jack Wilkinson: A bluff to bring Borussia Dortmund to the table, or a genuine alternative for the season until efforts to sign Jadon Sancho can be renewed next summer, on or off the pitch, Ousmane Dembele could certainly do a job for Manchester United. Dembele, a World Cup winner, undoubtedly comes with pedigree. Tasked with filling Neymar's boots, the 23-year-old was once the second-most expensive signing in football history when he moved from Dortmund to the Camp Nou in 2017. There was a promising start and glimpses of sheer brilliance, but with more time spent on the treatment table than on the field, it's fair to say Dembele's stint at Barcelona has fallen well short of expectation. In a little over three seasons, Dembele has featured in just 52 La Liga matches for Barcelona, scoring just 12 goals. In the same period, since the start of the 2017/18 season, Sancho has made 80 appearances and 30 goals for Dembele's former club Dortmund in the Bundesliga. The numbers are stacked in Sancho's favour and yet, as we enter the final week of the summer window, United are in talks with alternatives to their primary target. United may not be solely to blame for the Sancho impasse, but a move for an injury-prone player who has made just a single, 20-minute appearance throughout 2020 is symptomatic of the now frantic scramble to bring signings to Old Trafford, however much sense they make. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News reporter Gary Cotterill told The Transfer Show: ""Borussia Dortmund are pointing to a little bit of déjà vu. ""At the moment, one of the biggest clubs in the world is trying to sign a young, extremely talented attacking player, a 20-year-old from Dortmund. Three years ago, one of the biggest clubs in the world were trying to sign a very talented, much sought-after attacking player from Dortmund. ""This time, it's Manchester United trying to sign Sancho and three years ago, it was Barcelona trying to sign Dembele. Barca came in with a bid of €100m - that's a familiar figure - and Dortmund immediately rejected it, saying it wasn't enough - that sounds familiar as well. ""Negotiations continued, Dembele dug in, he started to agitate and even missed training a couple of times but Dortmund dug in as well. In the end, Barcelona paid the money that Dortmund initially wanted and with add-ons and extras, anything up to €150m. ""So is that a sign of how determined Dortmund are when it comes to the negotiation process? We'll have to wait and see if it ends in the same way.""

The sun is shining and all is well after a late turnaround in Eindhoven saw his team progress to the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League. Rodgers is proud of the performance. ""Twenty minutes to go, 1-0 down, and we were still calm,"" he tells Sky Sports. ""We played some great football."" But as he begins to reflect on a special night, other memories of the past 24 hours return. ""It was seeing the happiness of the players and the staff afterwards, sharing that moment with the supporters. We stayed overnight so coming back to the hotel we had all the staff there and had a meal together. That was great. Just the happiness of it all, really."" Sixteen-hundred supporters were there to see it, many more will now be planning their trip to Rome in the last four. ""We saw some supporters in the morning at the hotel who had stayed over. It is the joy. That is what it gives you. The supporters loved it, which is great."" All of which makes one wonder what the mood would now be like had Leicester not mustered that comeback. Thirteen minutes remained when James Maddison levelled the tie. Two minutes of normal time were left when Ricardo Pereira won it for his team. Both the scorers started the game but Ayoze Perez, the player who set up the equaliser did not. Nor did Ademola Lookman, the man whose movement was instrumental in the winner. This match was won thanks to the proactive substitutions of the manager. ""I felt that we had to make the change. We were fine in the game, then we concede a sloppy goal and then we had some really good chances. I said to the guys at half-time that unfortunately when you are in these situations there are no second chances."" Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Get NOW to stream big moments Football features Harvey Barnes was hooked, Marc Albrighton too. Lookman and Patson Daka came on. ""We went with two strikers up there with Madders from the side to start with. Pats is up there with Vardy in terms of being our best presser at the top of the pitch. ""It always sets the tempo."" Rodgers wanted to ""change the dynamic from the beginning of the half and then see how that was looking before making more changes"" - which he did when introducing Perez for Kelechi Iheanacho midway through the second half while still trailing. ""That was the idea. Once we had got Pats up and running in the game, it was a case of getting the extra bodies back in the game centrally."" Maddison changed position again. ""They were playing with two flat midfield players so he could just come in behind that."" It worked perfectly for the first goal. Perez feeding Maddison to crash the ball into the net. ""With Ayoze's position, I just felt that we needed someone in that half space. He had not featured a lot recently but he has trained well and I thought he was excellent."" Lookman's ability in tight areas was crucial for the second. ""They had scored so they were 1-0 up and sitting a little deeper so there was not so much space in behind. They were sitting back to protect the lead. I was then looking at somebody who could move a little bit freer on the inside and the outside."" Just as he planned it, then? ""Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't,"" laughs Rodgers. ""I do go into the game with a script of my own, anticipating what may happen and what may not. I will make a couple of notes and talk that through with my staff. Leading up to the game you are always thinking about it. How it may go and how it may not. ""Then it comes down to just the feel of the game. ""But you need players to be adaptable and flexible to take on what you want them to do."" You need them to be available too. No Premier League team has lost more minutes to injury this season than Leicester. During the bleakest times this winter, when they had won three Premier League games out of 14 and dropped out of the Europa League, not everybody wanted to hear about it. But the impact on performance was huge. In some instances, the effect is obvious. The remarkable Wesley Fofana only made his first Premier League appearance of the season earlier this month and has been hugely missed. Elsewhere, the consequences of the disruption have been a little more subtle. ""There is a snowball effect because other players have to be risked, you are hoping they get through it and then they don't. There is this constant knock-on effect. Some end up playing more than you would like when fatigued and that takes away the intensity of our game. ""It is only now that we are getting players back. Having that ability to make seven changes against Crystal Palace really demonstrated that we have players coming back. Even though we still have one or two out, we have a core now and I can trust the squad."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Palace were beaten, but that rotation was also crucial late on in Eindhoven. ""That selection allowed us to recover players for the game against PSV. In the last 15 minutes of the game, that fitness, that physicality, came through and helped give us the victory."" Expect more rotation in the coming weeks. ""I am just conscious with a number of these players how long they have been out. Wesley, James Justin, Ricardo Pereira, Timothy Castagne - these are guys we have to be careful with. Whatever team we put out there will be an intense, aggressive team. ""I don't go into any game not to win. It is more about the physical requirements, especially against teams that have had a week off. We will always fight, always put out a team to get a result, but for us to do that the team has to be intense, it has to be physical. ""I have a group that I trust now and we also have to manage it because we are playing virtually every midweek and have been for a while now. You cannot ask the same players to do that. Well, you can. But the risk of injury goes up and the level goes down."" Rodgers makes all the right noises about the game against Newcastle on Sunday, talks of the need to ""finish strongly"" in the Premier League, and volunteers the statistic they have three games in hand on a Wolves team that are nine points above them. But he is clearly aware that with only nine games remaining there are limits to what can be achieved in that competition this season. ""The reality for us is that eighth is the highest we can finish now,"" he says. The chance for more Leicester City glory lies elsewhere. This is a team with a taste for it now. ""What we have tried to bring to the club is that winning mentality. It is something you build on each day. In the last three seasons we have been in three semi-finals, won an FA Cup final and a Community Shield. There is an opportunity to win more."" There have been difficult times in between, but a season that began with a trophy celebration at Wembley, could yet end with the club's first European honours. ""Top 10 and a final would be a fantastic season considering everything we have gone through. ""Hopefully, it will be a nice ending for us.""

Liverpool reached the FA Cup final for the first time under Klopp thanks to a devastating first-half display at Wembley, where the Reds led 3-0 at half-time thanks to Sadio Mane's double and Ibrahima Konate's headed opener. City broke free from Liverpool shackles after the break. Jack Grealish reduced the arrears within seconds of the restart before Bernardo Silva's late strike set up a tense finale, but Klopp's side advantage proved insurmountable as the Reds maintained their bid for an unlikely quadruple. ""I think it was [one of our best performances],"" Klopp said. ""That was the feeling I had when I saw the first half because of the quality of the opponent. ""We did all the right stuff, we scored in the right moments; we played an incredible game in the first half, I have to say. I loved each second of it. ""To deny them in so many moments is so difficult, as is creating your own opportunities against them. The first half was outstanding in pretty much all parts of the game. The second half they scored an early goal, like we did [at the Etihad], and then the game opened up. No footballer on the planet is safe against City with a 3-1 lead, it is always clear what they can do. We needed Alisson, what a game he had, but we had our moments as well, and could have decided the game earlier. We didn't do it, but that made the game even more special, 3-2 was a fair result and it was good enough to bring us to the final."" Man City 2-3 Liverpool - Match report Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Saturday's triumph at Wembley kept Liverpool's bid for an unprecedented quadruple on track while ending City's hopes of a treble of their own. With the League Cup already in the bag, a place in the FA Cup final secured, a Champions League semi-final showdown with Villarreal booked, and with just a point between themselves and City at the top of the Premier League, Liverpool could produce a finale like no other to this season, but Klopp was eager to downplay their chances. ""You can mention it how many times you want, it doesn't make it more likely,"" he replied when asked about Liverpool's quadruple hopes. ""A game like today shows even more how unlikely it is. ""To go through against City is incredibly difficult and intense, and in three days we play again against Manchester United. They will be on their toes, and it is historically not a friendly game. ""A few days later we face Everton, that will not be a friendly game. Then we face Villarreal, that will not be a friendly game. Then Newcastle. It's incredibly intense and it is really unlikely the team will win all the games. ""We came here, we wanted to go to the final, we knew about the problems, but with the quadruple, qualifying for this kind of final makes it even more difficult. It is the only way to do it, but it makes it more difficult as well. It is a strange situation, but we are over the moon.

The goalkeeper, selected ahead of Ederson at Wembley, dithered on the ball from a John Stones backpass shortly after Konate's opener, allowing Mane to bundle the ball into the net. ""It was an accident,"" Guardiola told the BBC after the game. ""One of the strong points is try to play [out] and as a keeper he has this quality. ""It was an accident and he will learn for the future. When the ball is there, it can always happen. I have spoken with the team, not him personally, but he is strong."" Guardiola fielded a much-changed side after Kevin de Bruyne and Kyle Walker suffered injuries against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday and claimed Riyad Mahrez and Rodri were the only players on his bench fit enough to actually come on. ""When you play a lot of games, and you continue to do it, always these kind of situations can happen,"" he added in his press conference. ""The game in Madrid was really tough for us.

Cristiano Ronaldo sealed his hat-trick with a stunning free-kick to rescue a 3-2 victory for Man Utd over Norwich but it was another shoddy showing for the team. Norwich had created chances throughout the afternoon and scored more than one goal in an away game for just the third time this season. Kieran Dowell headed Teemu Pukki's cross past David de Gea on the stroke of half-time, and then the Finland striker beat the offside trap to level seven minutes into the second period. Rangnick said: ""If you look at the two goals we conceded, especially the first one, we had the ball on the sideline but we were just not physical enough. As soon as there is body contact we have to be more physical, more aggressive, but we weren't. ""It was, for me, too easy, and that's why we are probably the only team in the league who concedes goals like this."" He added: ""We should have defended in a smarter way and not allowed them to have two or three transitional moments with playing three versus two or four versus two. To be honest, Norwich could have scored earlier than we did concede the first goal. We could have conceded a goal earlier than that and that's why I'm not really happy with our performance when we were not in possession of the ball."" Ronaldo's 25-yard thunderbolt free-kick winner with 15 minutes remaining restored some good feeling around the ground, and put the hosts right back in contention to finish fourth. They are just three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham.

I mean, this is easily six, eight points that we should have easily have had more. But this brings us back to the same situation that we just didn't defend well enough in moments like this. And [had it not been for] David de Gea with a brilliant save, we could have been 3-2 down and then probably even have lost the game and this should not happen. ""If you want to defend properly in this league, you just have to be physical, you shouldn't just allow them to go past ourselves and through our lines like that. That's what this team doesn't do well enough, and that's why we're still mathematically in the race but we should have easily had eight points more."" The opposition gets tougher for Manchester United next when they travel to Liverpool on Tuesday at 8pm - live on Sky Sports Premier League - as Jurgen Klopp's team have their eyes on the Premier League title. Rangnick has admitted his team could be in for a long evening if they repeat the performance levels from the Norwich win. ""I mean, everybody has seen today's game,"" Rangnick said. ""We all know what team we're playing on Tuesday. ""They won against Man City today, they're in the FA Cup final. In the end they might have the chance to win four trophies this season. ""If we play like we played today, it will be very, very difficult to get even a point out of this game and this is what we have to be realistically aware of. ""So, we need to raise our own level and standard. Probably Fred and Scott (McTominay) will not be back, Raphael Varane will also be a tight race for the game on Tuesday. So far he hasn't trained with the team. ""We have to be aware that the players that we had available today we will drive to Liverpool and just get anything out of that game. ""If possible we need three points. That can happen in football, it has happened before. ""But we have to be realistic, we have to play a lot better if Liverpool is in possession of the ball than we did today."" Ralf Rangnick insists it is not right to target individuals after Paul Pogba was booed off the pitch by some Manchester United supporters during Saturday's 3-2 win over Norwich in the Premier League. Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick at Old Trafford boosted United's hopes of a top-four finish following defeats for rivals Arsenal and Tottenham, but the result glossed over another underwhelming performance and the home fans were not afraid to show their discontent. Pogba, whose United contract runs out at the end of the season, returned to the starting line-up but struggled to make an impact against the Premier League's bottom side and was replaced by Juan Mata in the 74th minute with the score at 2-2.

Rangnick said: ""I can understand if that the fans are frustrated and disappointed - so are we. Things have stayed, as far as I know, peaceful all the time.

Pogba, whose United contract runs out at the end of the season, returned to the starting line-up but struggled to make an impact against the Premier League's bottom side and was replaced by Juan Mata in the 74th minute with the score at 2-2.

Although Rangnick admits he did not hear the boos from a section of disgruntled supporters, he insists he does not agree with their actions. ""I didn't hear it myself, to be honest,"" Rangnick said. ""But we were talking about it with my staff in my office in the locker room. ""I think the fans here are amazing, I really do. The support in the stadium today was again great, it couldn't have been any better. Man Utd 3-2 Norwich - Match report & highlights Premier League table Man Utd fixtures Live football on Sky Sports ""I can understand if that the fans are frustrated and disappointed - so are we. Things have stayed, as far as I know, peaceful all the time. ""I don't think it makes sense to take on and to target any individual person or players because it's a collective responsibility. ""Even if you look into the past, for me it doesn't make sense and this is why I will always defend and protect my players."" The individual brilliance of Pogba's team-mate Ronaldo has put United just three points behind fourth-placed Spurs as the season heads into its final few weeks, but Rangnick's side continue to look defensively vulnerable. Norwich had only scored eight away goals in the Premier League this campaign before their trip to Manchester. Having had 15 shots in the game, Dean Smith's side will undoubtedly feel hard done by not to have come away from Old Trafford with at least a point. Rangnick said: ""We didn't defend well. Both goals we should have defended much better and David de Gea kept us in the game with a brilliant save. ""Overall, it was highly important to win the game, but the way that we played defensively after being 2-0 up was not enough. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's a question of intensity and physicality. Before the first goal, we had the ball at our feet at the sideline but if you are not physical enough in those moments to protect the ball then you can even lose the ball in those areas and within a few seconds they had a free header in our own box. ""It doesn't make sense to look and just be interested in the other results, we have to take care of our own results. Today we got the result but with the overall performance, we definitely have to raise that level against Liverpool on Tuesday and the same away at Arsenal and at home against Chelsea."" As for Ronaldo, he has now scored 60 hat-tricks in his professional career and has 21 goals for United this season in all competitions. ""Like against Tottenham, he was very crucial today,"" Rangnick added. ""The second and the third one were not easy goals, the way he took those two goals was just outstanding.""

Their two major top-four rivals lose and they move three points behind Tottenham in fourth. The numbers don't tell the whole story. Ralf Rangnick's side laboured again to a 3-2 win over basement club Norwich, who had scored only 20 goals all season but could have had a hatful at Old Trafford. Come the full-time whistle, the celebrations were muted at best and the most passionate reception was arguably reserved for Paul Pogba, who was booed loudly on his way down the tunnel. All had not been well at United all afternoon, with protests against the Glazer ownership overshadowing the build-up to the game and a large collection of fans waiting until the 17th minute to take their seats to signify the 17 years since the Americans took control of the club. The performance seemed the perfect reflection of their complaints - laborious and underwhelming, and all the more frustrating given the players were already aware Tottenham had handed them an opportunity by losing to Brighton in the early kick-off. United are back in the hunt but in name only. Scraping wins over a team almost certain to be relegated will get them nowhere, and repeat performances against Liverpool and Arsenal over the next week will end their top-four charge as quickly as it has been rejuvenated.Ron Walker Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Premier League table Premier League fixtures Premier League results Watch Premier League highlights As the Mohamed Salah contract saga rumbles on, it is easy to forget there is another member of Liverpool's attack with only a year remaining on his deal. Sadio Mane surely merits just as much fuss. Saturday's thrilling FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City was the fifth game in a row in which Salah has failed to find the net but his dip in form matters little when Mane continues to deliver performances as devastating as this. The Senegalese international, who triumphed over his team-mate at AFCON in February before then helping his country beat Egypt again for a place at the World Cup, followed up his crucial goals against Benfica and in the Premier League against City last weekend with a match-winning double at Wembley. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  His first goal rewarded his relentless work-rate as he closed down Zack Steffen and bundled the ball into the net, and he then displayed sensational technique when he guided a volley into the bottom corner from Thiago Alcantara's lofted pass for his second. City could not live with him, instead resorting to fouling him five times across the 90 minutes - no player won more free kicks - and he left the field to rapturous applause from the delirious Liverpool fans inside Wembley when he was withdrawn in the closing stages. In the end, his goals kept Liverpool's hopes of a quadruple alive. They were also a reminder that, while he may not attract as much acclaim as his fellow attacker, he is no less influential. Resolving his future must be a priority too.Nick Wright Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Manchester City's treble hopes ran aground at Wembley Stadium on an afternoon where the Premier League leaders were comprehensively beaten on the pitch and in the stands. Liverpool's victory was three dimensional. A flawless performance on the pitch was inspired by the staggeringly passionate and vociferous support from their travelling fans. Manchester City didn't stand a chance - and did themselves no favours. Pep Guardiola's team selection undoubtedly contributed to Liverpool's devastating first-half performance, with returnees Nathan Ake at fault for Ibrahima Konate's opener, and stand-in goalkeeper gifting Sadio Mane his first and Liverpool's second. Guardiola pointed to fixture congestion and fatigue as reason for his pre-match alterations, but the defeat owed as much to City's insipidness in attack in the first period as it did the errors. The Spaniard's reluctance to turn to his bench until the 83rd minute for his one - and only - change only exacerbated City's plight. With the Premier League title run-in yet to unfold, and with a potential third and final instalment of City and Liverpool's rivalry to come if both sides reach the Champions League final, this was a startling and sobering reminder of the threat Liverpool pose in one-off games, and even spells of matches. Supported to the hilt, and capable of blowing any team in world football away, this Liverpool performance should serve as a warning to City that while they may well overcome their adversaries over the stretch of a Premier League season, discovering the sprint finish or knockout blow may be required to prevent Liverpool from getting their hands on the prizes they crave.Jack Wilkinson Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Perhaps come the end of the season, we'll look back on this weekend as the moment Tottenham let Manchester United back into the top four race. The focus immediately after their defeat at home to Brighton was the prospect of Arsenal drawing level if they could win at Southampton. Some poor finishing from Mikel Arteta's side spared Spurs from that but United are now back in the contest. Whether this round proves to be a let-off or a costly slip-up, Antonio Conte was keen for his Tottenham players to learn their lesson. ""Once you reach a good position in the table you have to try to keep this position,"" he said. ""It's a good opportunity for us to cope with pressure. When you're [in a team that's] winning the league you have to cope with pressure from other results and this is a good opportunity for these players, who needed these kinds of exams for improvement."" For Conte, it's about building the blocks of experience for this Tottenham team to achieve greater things in the future. After all, this is a manager who is more accustomed to fighting for titles than fighting for fourth. The mistake they made on Saturday, he said, was being too anxious to push for victory in the final stages - and leaving the space for Leandro Trossard to grab a late winner at the other end. Playing in the lunchtime kick-off, Spurs' players felt the pressure to put down a marker before their rivals kicked off. ""A lesson we can learn today is that there are games that if you're not able to win, you're not to lose,"" said Conte. ""It was very clear that today wasn't our day. I understand we want to try to get three points before our other rivals for the race in the Champions League but sometimes we need to feel."" There are plenty more twists in this top-four race to come and every point will count.Peter Smith ""Forty points with six games to go. Not so bad considering it was Armageddon three games ago!"" Graham Potter took enjoyment in Brighton's return to form in his press conference following the win over Tottenham. There was a dig at the critics who point to their struggles to score goals, too. After a long, bizarre and perhaps tricky to understand run of one win in 13 matches (inside 90 minutes), Brighton have two in two from doing a north London double over Arsenal and Spurs. Watching them up close in both matches, it's hard to believe how a team so well organised could have had such an awful streak. At the back, they prevented a Spurs side, which had scored at least twice in each of their last seven, from having a single shot on target. Lewis Dunk did an excellent job in limiting Harry Kane's involvement. Ahead of him in midfield, Yves Bissouma was superb, with and without the ball. It's in the final third where Brighton have had their biggest struggles this season - as referenced by Potter - but with a slick drop of the shoulder and prod into the bottom corner, Leandro Trossard came up with the moment of quality to deliver a first win at Spurs since 1981. A historic goal and perhaps a historic performance. There was talk in the press room afterwards from long-time Brighton watchers that it may have been their best display since they came up to the Premier League. Potter's view was it was certainly a step up from their display at Arsenal. However you want to rank it, Brighton have ridden through the tough moments this season and have come out the other side with two significant wins. They're back to their best and a strong finish to the season beckons.Peter Smith Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  When questions were being asked of Antonio Conte's position at Tottenham following a 1-0 loss to relegation-threatened Burnley in February, very few people would have predicted the standings would now favour Spurs in the race for fourth place. With six games to play - seven for Arsenal - Spurs hold the fourth and final Champions League spot, but only because teams around them have proceeded to crumble just as they have found some renewed form. Arsenal have wasted chances against Crystal Palace, Brighton and now Southampton to wrestle ascendency in the battle for a top-four finish - it's as if they no longer want it. Mikel Arteta conceded that his side's form is a 'worry' entering the backend of a defining campaign for the Gunners - with this being their third run of three straight defeats under the Spaniard. What's worse is they have now opened the door to Manchester United. What was a two-horse race is now three. A season that promised so much is unravelling quickly for Arsenal, who now need a result from Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night to restore some conviction in their Champions League bid. Arteta's praise of Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster was merited - he kept Saints in the game - but Arsenal did not do enough to dissolve the stopper's purpose. Undoubtedly, there will be further surprises in the race for fourth, but what's certain is that if Arsenal don't improve swiftly, it will not be them playing Champions League football in 2022/23.Laura Hunter Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A smattering of boos at half time told you everything you needed to know about Watford's first-half performance against Brentford. The Hornets were 1-0 down, had mustered one shot on target and were second best in all areas. It was a display that befitted a team winless at home since November. To their credit, Watford were much better in the second half and had Imran Louza not wasted a great chance in the 92nd minute, the Hornets could well have completed a superb comeback win. But such is the way it is going for Watford at home this season, they conceded a last-minute Pontus Jansson winner that saw them crash to a record 10th consecutive home loss - the worst record in the club's history. For Hodgson, the defeat was all down to that sluggish first-half. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He said: ""We really needed each and every player right from the very first minute to be at the top of his game. Now that was by no means the case. ""We did remedy, to some extent in the second half, some of the worst aspects of our first half performance, and we gave ourselves a chance; we equalised and we could even have got that winner. ""But it would have been nice if we could have done it from the very first minute because then maybe we wouldn't even been behind at half time."" The defeat, which leaves Watford second bottom and six points adrift of safety, edges them closer to an immediate return to the Championship. Hodgson's message for their final six games, starting next Saturday at leaders Manchester City? ""One has to believe, one has to keep faith, one has to take some sort of heart from their desire and commitment and effort during the second half,"" the 74-year-old said. ""You just have to hope that six times 95 minutes more, they'll be able to do that and maybe, who knows, we will pick up points we aren't expected to and we will get ourselves back in the race.""Declan Olley Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Brentford are one of the form teams in the Premier League right now. Their last-gasp win at Watford was their fifth victory in six games - only Liverpool have taken more points than the Bees in that period. It means their next two fixtures against Tottenham and Manchester United now look far more complicated for those two top-four chasing clubs than it did at the end of February, when defeat at home to Newcastle had left Brentford winless in eight games. Download Sky Sports app | Get Sky Sports But any concerns that the resurgent Bees are likely to take their foot off the gas now that they are all-but safe from relegation, were immediately dismissed by head coach Thomas Frank after the win at Vicarage Road. ""I'm happy that we are on a decent amount of points, but I want more,"" he declared. ""We're now on 39 points, we're trying to keep focused on winning the next game and finish as high as possible. ""It's been a crazy season for us, a remarkable season."" Things could get even crazier for Brentford though if they were to beat either Tottenham at home next Saturday, live on Sky Sports, or Manchester United at Old Trafford on May 2, also live on Sky Sports. But Frank knows they will have to perform at a better level than their win at Watford if they are to have a say on the top-four race. ""I think in the first-half we were a tiny bit better than Watford, without being fantastic,"" he said. ""In the second-half, Watford had the momentum and were a little bit more on top of the game. ""In football it's very rare that you have these top performances and you win week-after-week. There's also days where you are six or seven out of 10 in terms of performance, and I think that was today.""Declan Olley Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

The 2-2 draw between the sides at the Etihad Stadium last Sunday left the Premier League title race in the balance, but Liverpool struck a blow to their rivals with a 3-2 win at Wembley to reach the FA Cup final on Saturday. The first clash of the season between the teams also ended in a 2-2 draw at Anfield in October, and unsurprisingly there is very little to separate the sides in the league, with City holding a one-point advantage with seven matches remaining. It's undoubtedly a two-horse race between City and Liverpool for the title, but how do the run-ins of the two sides compare? What are the key fixtures? And how will City's search for an elusive Champions League title - and Liverpool's bid for a seventh - affect the title race? On paper, there is no question that City have an easier run-in than Liverpool, something that their fans will surely be hoping gives them a crucial advantage as the hunt for the Premier League enters its final stages. Pep Guardiola's side only have three fixtures against sides currently in the top half of the table (Wolves, Brighton and West Ham) and none of them are against sides currently in the top six. The game at Molineux is arguably the toughest City will face during their run-in, for two reasons. The game does not yet have a date having been postponed due to City's participation in the FA Cup semi-finals, making it a harder task to prepare for, while City have only won once in three visits to Wolves since they returned to the top flight under Nuno Espirito Santo in 2018. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Download the Sky Sports app Premier League table City's trip to Brighton on Wednesday looks like a potential banana skin after the Seagulls' recent wins over Arsenal and Tottenham, but the champions have a strong record at the Amex Stadium, winning four of their last five visits and scoring 17 goals. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It's a similar story with the West Ham game, which is live on Sky Sports - City have won four of their last five games in east London by an aggregate score of 18-2. If the Hammers reach the Europa League final next month, that game will fall just three days before City's visit to the London Stadium and will surely take priority over any Premier League fixture, given David Moyes' side are six points adrift of the top four. Guardiola's side will expect to see off Watford, Leeds and Newcastle - the latter two of those games are also live on Sky Sports - but the final-day fixture at home to Aston Villa presents an intriguing prospect. If the title is still on the line, could former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard - who was famously never able to bring the Premier League title to Anfield as a player - get a result at the Etihad and hand his former side the trophy? While City's run-in may lack headline fixtures, Liverpool's is stacked with them. Matches don't come much bigger than Liverpool against Manchester United, and Jurgen Klopp's side must negotiate that task on Tuesday, live on Sky Sports. However, a visit from their struggling north-west rivals does not spark the fear it once did, particularly given Liverpool have not lost at home to United in over six years. They will also know that three points over Ralf Rangnick's outfit will move them back to the top of the Premier League table, given City's next match is 24 hours later. Liverpool then face another huge game next Sunday when Merseyside rivals Everton travel to Anfield, live on Sky Sports. While the Toffees' immediate priority is staying in the top flight, they would love nothing more than to derail the Reds' title bid, and they did win 2-0 at Anfield last season. A trip to St James' Park to take on a Newcastle side that are much improved under Eddie Howe, follows before hosting Tottenham, who are likely to still be desperate for points in their quest to finish in the top four. Antonio Conte's team led twice when they drew 2-2 with Liverpool in December, while Klopp has only beaten the Italian once in his managerial career. A reunion with Gerrard is then on the agenda when Liverpool take on Aston Villa and Southampton - live on Sky Sports - in successive away games before they end their season at home to Wolves. Klopp complained about Liverpool's schedule in the build-up to their win over City on Saturday, and he is unlikely to be happy about the scheduling of their Champions League fixtures in comparison to their title rivals. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The first leg of Liverpool's semi-final against Villarreal on Wednesday, April 27 is sandwiched between their Sunday evening game against Everton and their trip to Newcastle on the following Saturday that kicks off at 12.30pm. City's first leg against Real Madrid is on Tuesday, April 26 and takes place between a Saturday lunchtime game at home to Watford and their trip to Leeds in the evening of the following Saturday. The scheduling means City will have more than 24 extra hours to prepare for their game against Leeds than Liverpool will for theirs against Newcastle - a situation that prompted the Reds to ask the Premier League to move their trip to St James' Park. City will also get an extra day to prepare for their second game against Real, while both they and Liverpool will have three days between their Champions League second legs and their next Premier League fixture. Liverpool have faced the most gruelling schedule this season, playing 52 games in all competitions to City's 49, having won the Carabao Cup in February after City's early exit. Should Klopp's side overcome Villarreal to reach the Champions League final - and with an FA Cup final on the horizon next month - their overall number of games played this season will stretch to 63, a total only surpassed by five sides in Premier League history.

The club have lost Roger Hunt in the last few days, one of the greatest goalscorers the club has ever seen. ""Mo Salah is one of them, in terms of Ian Rush, Roger Hunt... Mo Salah is up there. He goes into a Liverpool greatest XI. ""You think of the greatest players Liverpool have had - he goes on that right side, there's absolutely no doubt about it. ""I know the situation Liverpool are in. They don't have the finances of Manchester City when you think of the wages they give out. But right now, Salah is playing as well as anyone in European football. ""Liverpool cannot afford to let his contract situation drag on, with the threat they could lose him in the next two years. ""This is a guy who really looks after himself, and you can see that when he takes his top off when he scores a goal. ""I'm not saying he's going to be like Cristiano Ronaldo when he's 35 or 36, still topping the goalscoring charts, but I think this lad's got a lot in him as he goes into his 30s. ""It's imperative that at his peak he's still scoring goals in the red shirt of Liverpool."" Salah said his goal would have felt more special if Liverpool had won the game but admitted the draw was a fair result. ""It's hard because they keep a ball a lot,"" he told Sky Sports. ""The first half not really good but the second half we played good. This is the result so we have to accept it. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""They dominated the game from the beginning. We struggled first half but at least when we struggled it was 0-0. We talked in the dressing room and I think we played good in the second half. ""I have to be fair. They create a lot of chances, they keep the ball a lot. I wish I could say no but it's fair to say yes. They had a lot of chances and a draw is a fair result."" On his goal, he added: ""I have to watch it to see. It would be more special if we won the game but it is what it is. It's a good goal but nothing much to say."" Liverpool go to Watford after the international break for a 12.30pm kick-off on Saturday, October 16, while Man City will pick up again at home to Burnley on the same day at 3pm. Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6. Play for free, entries by 3pm. ",positive,liverpool,15

The 25-year-old has signed a five-and-a-half-year contract with the Premier League side and will wear the number 23 shirt. The fee for Diaz could rise to as much as £49m if potential add-ons are triggered during his time at Anfield. The Colombia international was a top target for manager Jurgen Klopp in the summer, but interest from Tottenham this month accelerated their plans. Spurs wanted to sign Diaz during the current window and were willing to pay up to £46m, but the winger preferred a move to Liverpool. ""He's an outstanding player and someone we've been tracking for a very long time,"" Klopp told Liverpool's official website. ""We believe he has everything needed to fit into our way and adapt to the Premier League, both physically and mentally. Transfer Centre LIVE! January transfer window: Done deals January window: Club-by-club deals Paper Talk ""He's a player who is hungry for success and knows you have to fight to get what you want. He is a fighter, no doubt. He's a skillful team player who has always the goal in mind. ""This team deserved to add quality and when we played against Luis earlier this season, we saw what a danger he is, how fast he is and how his mentality was to help his team. ""Luis is a player we believe will make us better now and in the future. He's the player we really wanted and they've (the owners) made it happen, so I'm very happy."" Luis Diaz will be among good company when he pulls on his new No 23 shirt for the first time. The number was assigned to Liverpool legends Jamie Carragher and Robbie Fowler during their time at Anfield, while Emre Can and Xherdan Shaqiri are more recent recipients of the honour. Diaz underwent a medical in Argentina as he is on international duty with Colombia for their World Cup qualifiers. He played in both of Porto's matches against Liverpool in the Champions League this season, but was unable to help them avoid a 5-1 home defeat in September or a 2-0 loss at Anfield in November. The deal represents a big coup for Julian Ward, who is set to succeed Liverpool sporting director Michael Edwards in the summer, as he took the reins in negotiations. Diaz requires a work permit to enter the UK, meaning he is unlikely to arrive in Liverpool until the end of next week at the earliest. Liverpool's next match is at home to Cardiff in the FA Cup on Sunday, February 6. Sky Sports' Adam Bate: While Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah are away at the Africa Cup of Nations, Liverpool have acted to future-proof their forward line. Roberto Firmino turned 30 in October, while Mane and Salah will both do so later this year. The trio are legendary figures at the club but the balance of the attack needs to shift. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The arrival of Diogo Jota, 25, helped to freshen things up, taking minutes from Firmino this season. Luis Diaz could mean the same for Mane as he too operates in that left channel. The Senegal international scored against Chelsea recently but had gone nine games without a goal before that. Liverpool faced a big challenge in transitioning away from the team that delivered the Champions League trophy and the Premier League title. Diaz can help. He is coming into his peak years and appears an astute signing, a player with an appetite to prove himself in the Premier League. If the signing proves successful, and the transition seamless, Liverpool will believe they are building that new forward line for the future. Perhaps Jurgen Klopp's next great team is being constructed. Portuguese football expert Filipe Dias on Transfer Talk: ""Luis Diaz, the best player in the Portuguese league, is going to be joining Liverpool. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""He is the kind of player Klopp likes. Technically he is very gifted - he is bound for greater things than the Portuguese league. ""Diaz is the best Colombian player at the moment, the best player in Portugal at the moment. He can do anything up front despite not being a centre forward. ""He really has something special about him. There is no doubt in my mind that, if things go normally, he will fit in perfectly at Liverpool."" Sky Sports' Adam Smith: A quick glance at his headline stats in the Portuguese Primeira Liga this season suggests the 25-year-old provides a serious goal threat - but also offers so much more. The winger ranks top for goals, shots and touches in the opposition box and is among the elite for winning back possession in the final third, creating chances, attempting fast breaks, aerials, dribbling and passes in the attacking third. The maps below narrow down his goal threat to Champions League appearances over the past two seasons and reveal Diaz is most potent from his favoured left channel, frequently carving chances for team-mates with diagonals into the box. Besides scoring goals, his most striking attribute is participation in overall play, with above-average numbers for passes in the final third - but the graphic below suggests Diaz also frequently tracks back to support the team. When visualising his goal and passing averages, Diaz emerges among an elite crop of players in Europe's top leagues, with returns on par with Karim Benzema and Mohamed Salah. His heat map below emphasises his work-rate with concentrations of activity in his defensive half, while his ability to reclaim possession high up the pitch would certainly suit a high-press style. After securing the arrival of Diaz, Liverpool have now turned their attention to signing Fulham's attacking midfielder Fabio Carvalho. Carvalho has just six months remaining on his contract at Craven Cottage, with the Reds one of a number of clubs interested in the 19-year-old. One source has told Sky Sports News Liverpool have submitted a £5m bid for the youngster - although this has not been confirmed by either club. Fulham are confident Carvalho will be their player until the end of the season, although it is believed Liverpool want to get a deal done for the player before Monday's deadline. However, if it does not happen by then, it is unlikely to happen at all as Liverpool do not want to go to tribunal, with the Reds instead preferring to loan Carvalho back to Fulham for the rest of the season. Carvalho made his first-team debut for Fulham last season and has gone on to establish himself this campaign with seven goals and four assists in 19 appearances. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking earlier this week, Fulham boss Marco Silva insisted Carvalho would not leave the club this month, despite it potentially being the final opportunity to receive a transfer fee for him. ""Fabio will be with us until the end of the season,"" Silva. ""I would like to see him here for more years. ""From day one I have been trying to keep him. It is not a surprise that clubs are interested in Fabio. We are talking about a young player with big talent. ""The situation is not easy because he is in the last year of his contract, but that is the reality. It is out of our plans for him to leave the club in this window. ""It has been difficult for us to renew with him, but we are trying. ""It is always difficult with a player of this talent - even with a contract it is difficult to keep him, and without it is even worse. But Fabio will be with us until the end of this season."" Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: It is not hard to see why Liverpool are interested in signing Carvalho, who at just 19 and as a versatile forward who likes to operate on the lefthand side of a front three, would tick a lot of boxes when it comes to the profile of an attacking player Jurgen Klopp likes to sign. Not only that, but having been in the UK since moving here from Portugal aged 11, Carvalho also qualifies as a homegrown player, an added attraction for Liverpool. However, whether Fulham would be willing to sell someone who has been so integral to their push to get back in the Premier League this season is open to question, even if the west London club would get more for the England U18 international in January than if they wait till the summer when his contract at Craven Cottage runs out. In that scenario, as was also the case when Harvey Elliott left Fulham for Liverpool in July 2019, Fulham would only get a compensation fee - decided by a tribunal - for Carvalho. So do Fulham opt to cash in on their star man now - clubs in Spain are also reportedly keen on the youngster, although the compensation fee the Cottagers would get from La Liga clubs is far lower than if they sold to a Premier League side - but risk hindering their chances of a top-flight return? Or do they hold on to him until the end of the season in the hope Carvalho can help them hold on to top spot in the Championship, when the financial riches they would receive would negate any reduction in the forward's transfer fee? Meanwhile, Bournemouth have expressed an interest in taking Liverpool right-back Neco Williams on loan until the end of the season. Liverpool are understood to be weighing up the Championship club's interest in their Wales international. Williams, 20, is pushing for the chance for regular first-team football as he wants to play for Wales in their World Cup qualifiers in March. The clock is ticking.

Sources in Portugal suggest Spurs are prepared to offer €45m (£37.6m) up front for Diaz, with an additional €10m (£8.4m) in performance-related add-ons. However, Porto are holding out for a fee of €60m (£50.2m) for the 25-year-old, who has 16 goals and six assists in 28 games for the Portuguese side this season.

Diaz also shone at last summer's Copa America, where he helped Colombia to third place and finished as the tournament's joint top-scorer alongside Lionel Messi with four goals. Antonio Conte has made it clear since joining Spurs in November he is keen to ""rebuild"" his squad and the north London side could be set for a busy final week of the January transfer window.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Spurs are in talks to sign Luis Diaz from Porto. Portuguese sources have told us Spurs are willing to pay €45m for him, plus €10m in add-ons. Porto I think want about €60m, so the two clubs are not that far apart. ""Diaz is a Colombian winger. He's got two-and-a-half years left on his contract. Liverpool were interested in signing him. Lots of clubs have been watching him. ""At Porto's game this weekend, there were scouts from Manchester United, Atletico Madrid and Borussia Dortmund."" Sky Sports' Declan Olley: Tottenham fans have been here before. Paulo Dybala and Bruno Fernandes in the summer of 2019, and even Joao Moutinho way back in the summer of 2012. They were the nearly men. The big-name signings the club were sensationally set to pull off, only for them to fall through. The false dawns have become all too familiar for Spurs fans and they are unlikely to settle for another repeat with Porto's Luis Diaz, and more importantly, nor will head coach Conte. The next two windows are critical in the Italian's future at Tottenham. Back him and Spurs have the chance to get themselves back in the Champions League and start competing for honours. But fail to match his ambition and Tottenham will not just drift further from the elite, they will risk losing Conte. A successful move for Diaz would prove Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is serious in backing Conte. A £46m deal for the Colombian, or even the £50.2m that Porto are holding out for, would be the second-most expensive signing in Tottenham's history. The move makes sense on the pitch too. Spurs' reliance on Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son's goals is clear - 56 per cent of the team's goals in the Premier League since the start of last season have been scored by the pair. Diaz could bring the extra firepower the squad needs, having scored 20 goals in 37 appearances in all competitions for club and country this season. There is no doubt Diaz would be an exciting signing. But Spurs fans have been here before, and until he is wearing the shirt, they will continue to question the club's commitment in backing the best manager they could possibly have right now. A quick glance at his headline stats in the Portuguese Primeira Liga this season suggests the 25-year-old provides serious goal threat - but also offers so much more. The winger ranks top for goals, shots and touches in the opposition box and is among the elite for winning back possession in the final third, creating chances, attempting fast breaks, aerials, dribbling and passes in the attacking third.

Barcelona agreed a loan move with a £29m option to make the deal permanent, after Traore was left unconvinced by Tottenham's interest. A Barcelona statement read: ""FC Barcelona and Wolverhampton Wanderers have reached an agreement for the loan of the player Adama Traore until 30 June 2022. The blaugranes will pay the player's wages and there is an option to make the deal permanent. ""The presentation of Adama Traore as a new FC Barcelona player will be on Wednesday 2 February behind closed doors. The club will announce further details shortly."" Wolves' technical director, Scott Sellars, added: ""Adama has always acted with the utmost professionalism, however it is no secret that we have not been able to agree a new contract with him, despite protracted negotiations, and his desire at the moment is to play football elsewhere. ""Everyone knows Barcelona is a city, and club, very close to Adama's heart, so it is a dream move for him. We have also agreed a very healthy option in the deal should Barcelona wish to make the move permanent this summer. ""We wish Adama the best of luck in Spain, and hope that he plays regularly, has great success and shows everyone what he is capable of."" Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports Sky Sports News reported earlier this week that Spurs were closing in on a £20m deal for the 26-year-old after their previous bid of £15m was rejected, but Traore was not keen on the Premier League club's desire to use him in a variety of positions. He had been a long-time target of Spurs, who were in talks to sign Traore at the end of the summer transfer window. That interest remained despite the change of head coach from ex-Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo to Antonio Conte. Analysis by Sky Sports' Adam Bate: Missing out on Adama Traore represents a huge blow for Antonio Conte and Tottenham - this was a deal that was thought to be all but secured with the club keen to add further signings as well. Failure to land the Spain international leaves them with a problem. Traore had been identified to bring impetus at wing-back where Emerson Royal has lacked the creativity to beat a man in the opposition third. While Traore's defending has been questioned, nobody doubts his ball-carrying ability would have added a new dimension. The talk now is that he never fancied the position. Traore has only been used there in desperation by Bruno Lage - when trailing Brentford and Crystal Palace - and last had a run at wing-back under Nuno Espirito Santo in the autumn of 2019, with mixed results. More likely is that the interest from Barcelona changed his mind. Although Traore has spent the past six-and-a-half years in England, adapting well, Catalonia has always been home. He joined Barca's youth set-up aged eight and made his La Liga debut for the club at 17. The chance to return as an international player in his prime and ready to make an impact under his one-time team-mate Xavi Hernandez is an opportunity that he will have craved. Now he looks set to get that chance. For Tottenham, the search continues. The clock is ticking. Who will be on the move before the transfer window closes at 11pm on Monday January 31?

Ndombele - who became Spurs' record signing when he joined from Lyon for £63m in July 2019 - has returned to Lyon to bring an end to his disappointing spell at Tottenham. The Ligue 1 side have paid a £1.2m loan fee and retain the option to make the deal permanent in the summer for a reported £54m. Ndombele will help to replace Bruno Guimaraes, who joined Newcastle for £40m on Sunday. Tottenham released a brief, 46-word statement to announce Ndombele's exit, which featured none of the usual pleasantries handed out by a club when a player leaves. ""Tanguy Ndombele has joined Ligue 1 side Olympique Lyonnais on loan until the end of the season,"" said Spurs. ""The central midfielder returns to the club from which he joined us in July 2019.

The 25-year-old did not play for the club again following the incident. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Despite his struggles at Spurs, Paris Saint-Germain, Everton and Valencia all tried to sign Ndombele this month. Spurs have also let midfielder Giovani Lo Celso leave on Deadline Day after he secured a loan move to Villarreal. The Argentine, who has struggled for form and fitness during his time at the club, has made 19 appearances in all competitions this season, scoring just once. The 25-year-old joined the north London club on loan in August 2019 from Real Betis, before making the switch permanent in January 2020 for £27m. But he will now return to Spain with Villarreal for a reunion with their head coach Unai Emery, who managed him at Paris Saint-Germain. Tottenham winger Bryan Gil has also departed the club this month after signing for Valencia on loan until the end of the season. The 20-year-old joined last summer from Sevilla, in a swap-plus-cash deal which saw Erik Lamela join the Spanish side with Spurs paying the Andalusian side £21.6m for Gil, according to Sky in Italy. The Spaniard has made 20 appearances in all competitions this season but is yet to start a Premier League game and has not scored a goal. The departures of Ndombele, Lo Celso and Gil paved the way for Spurs to make two signings on Deadline Day after the club completed a double deal for Juventus pair Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur. Winger Kulusevski joins on an 18-month loan deal that costs Spurs £8.3m - £2.5m this season and £5.8m next season - while there is an obligation to buy the Sweden international for £29.2m if certain sporting criteria are met. Meanwhile, midfielder Bentancur joins permanently after signing a four-and-a-half-year deal subject to international clearance and a work permit. The deal for the Uruguay international could cost up to £21.5m with Tottenham paying Juve £15.8m up front, with £5.7m due in potential add-ons. Fabio Paratici, Tottenham's managing director of football, oversaw the signings of both Kulusevski from Atalanta in January 2020 and Bentancur from Boca Juniors in 2017 during his time at Juventus. After completing the deals for Kulusevski and Bentancur, Sky Sports News has been told it is unlikely Spurs will sign any more players before the deadline. There could yet still be one more departure from Spurs on Deadline Day, with Dele Alli set to undergo a medical ahead of a permanent move to Everton that could cost up to £40m. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Everton chairman Bill Kenwright has held talks in his London office with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy about a potential deal for Alli. Initially it was thought any move was a long way from completion, however, it is now understood a breakthrough has been made in negotiations and a medical has been booked in for the player. If Alli does move to Goodison Park, it will be on a two-and-a-half-year contract, with the transfer fee structured around payments based on the midfielder's performances for Everton. While any potential deal for Alli has not yet been formally agreed, it is believed the chances of the transfer taking place are ""looking good"", with new Everton manager Frank Lampard a key factor in convincing the 25-year-old to join.

""He had a desire to get in the box. He was always nasty, playing on the edge, getting sent off once or twice, but today he was non-existent. He's been like that for a year or two."" More than two years have passed since then, and we are still yet to see Alli return to the sort of form that took him to back-to-back PFA young player of the year awards. Still only 25, Alli has now worked under several managers at Spurs since breaking into the first team under Mauricio Pochettino and yet he has failed to fully convince Jose Mourinho, Nuno Espirito Santo and Antonio Conte he is worth giving a central role. It is hard to pinpoint his fall from grace, but Frank Lampard could be the ideal manager to turn a lost talent back into star quality. The new Everton boss would urge him to get back to basics, but feeling loved is what Alli needs. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  His time at Tottenham truly ought to have come to an end some time ago, but a fresh start at Everton, a side he has often performed well against, provides him with an opportunity to fulfil his undoubted talent. It is an arrangement that suits all parties, with Tottenham now able to build a squad in Conte's image, while Alli's ability to cover distance and play with intensity is something Everton have needed to inject into their game this season. A loan deal might have not led anywhere, pushing the need for a change along, but with Everton already having used up their two domestic loan slots, a permanent deal brings closure for Alli at Spurs. Lampard and Everton will hope he can now rediscover his old swagger on Merseyside. Sky Sports' Adam Bate: As Dele Alli's Tottenham career reaches a conclusion that few could have anticipated when he won back-to-back PFA young player of the year awards, much of the focus will be on the mental side of the game. The need to refocus will be at the forefront of the discussion. The words of Jose Mourinho in conversation with Alli in a much-publicised documentary appear prescient. ""I think you will regret it if you do not reach what you can reach."" But it is worth noting that there are tactical questions to address here as well as mental ones. The hope is that Frank Lampard and Everton appreciate what is required to bring out the best in Alli. His impact came as a support striker making late runs into the penalty box. He was combative and cute so could play deeper but that was not his main strength. Over time, Alli has been deployed further and further away from the opposition goal, even used in a midfield two, where the responsibilities in the build-up play put greater emphasis on other aspects of his game. It has become hard to remember what made him so good. Whether he is able to recapture that remains to be seen. At 25, there is still time. The attitude will need to be right, the desire to prove people wrong essential. But his only chance of doing that will be if Lampard has a clear vision of how to utilise him. Everton have appointed Frank Lampard as their new manager on a two-and-a-half-year contract to replace the sacked Rafael Benitez. Lampard, who arrived at Everton's Finch Farm training ground on Monday where he was expected to take first-team training for the first time, said: ""It is a huge honour for me to represent and manage a club the size and tradition of Everton Football Club.

Villa's opening offer was worth around £16.5m, with more than £4m in bonuses, but Juve want around £21m up front to be interested. Sky in Italy believe the two sides are not too far apart in their negotiations before the transfer window shuts on Monday. But Tottenham are also now interested in the Uruguayan, although the north London side are looking at a loan deal, which the Serie A side are not keen on. Sky Sports News understands Juve are holding out for more money, partly because 30 per cent of the fee would go to Bentancur's former club Boca Juniors as part of a sell-on clause in his contract. Juventus signed Bentancur from Boca Juniors for £8m in July 2017 with his current contract expiring in the summer of 2024. Villa boss Steven Gerrard believes the 24-year-old would strengthen his midfield options, and specifically offer good competition for Douglas Luiz. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Latest Premier League news Watch Premier League highlights Bentancur has made 26 appearances for Juve in all competitions this season, but has started 13 of their 23 Serie A matches. Bentancur is not the only Juventus player Tottenham are interested in ahead of the window shutting on Monday. Spurs are in talks to sign winger Dejan Kulusevski on loan, although no agreement has been reached yet and there is no decision if an option to buy will be included in any deal. The move for the Sweden international comes after Liverpool moved into pole position to sign Porto winger Luis Diaz, who prefers a move to Jurgen Klopp's side rather than Spurs, while Wolves wide man Adam Traore is on the verge of joining Barcelona. Tottenham have now turned their attentions to the 21-year-old, who was signed at Juve by Tottenham's managing director football Fabio Paratici when he was the Italian side's transfer chief. Kulusevski joined Juve from Atalanta in a deal worth up to £37m in January 2020 and his contract expires in the summer of 2025. The clock is ticking.

Kane scored twice at the Etihad, including a dramatic 95th-minute winner that ended the Premier League leaders' 15-game unbeaten streak. The England captain wanted to join the champions in the summer, but City never came up with an offer that even got close to Spurs' valuation. Kane's performance at the Etihad justified Tottenham's firm stance and showed why City boss Pep Guardiola had desperately pursued the striker last summer, as he inspired Spurs to a victory that reignites their Champions League hopes. Carragher said of Kane's display: ""That was one of the best performances I've seen this season, it really was. It was a privilege to watch. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""What made it so special was that Kane didn't get a lot of the ball, but when it came into him, everything he did was pure class. ""Kane is one of the best passers of the ball in the Premier League, he's not far behind [Kevin] De Bruyne."" Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Latest Tottenham news Tottenham fixtures Fellow Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness was also full of praise for Kane. ""Harry Kane was fantastic,"" he said. ""He's put himself in the shop window again. Not just his goals but his general play. ""He was a real problem. He gets over the ball, he's got the technique and the vision to see things, and he can deliver on what he sees. ""Some of his passing today was an absolute delight, as good as it gets."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  City boss Guardiola revealed on Friday the club had approached Tottenham four times over signing Kane last summer. Following Kane's match-winning display on Saturday night, Guardiola was asked about his admiration for the 28-year-old: ""It never was an option and everyone knows this so forget [it]. It's in the past. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's not necessary for him to show today the goals he scored and his quality with the ball. Everyone knows it."" Kane has scored six goals in his last eight games in all competitions and is beginning to rediscover his best form under head coach Antonio Conte. The Italian said of Kane after the win at City: ""We are talking about a world-class striker. He's working very well and he's also improving his physical aspects. ""I'm working with him to become a point of reference for us. In the past, he's liked to go outside the box and he's also very good at this."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Kane's goals moved Tottenham four points off the top four, with Spurs effectively having three games in hand over fourth-placed Manchester United, who face Leeds at Elland Road on Sunday, live on Sky Sports. Speaking to Sky Sports after the win, Kane said: ""It was a crazy game. We worked so hard for so long. We were 2-1 ahead for such a long time in the second half. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Then to see the penalty awarded was so heart-breaking, but credit to the boys for creating another chance at the end. ""For me it was [about ending] three losses in a row and we had to find a way of getting our season back on track. To get the result we did was really, really special. ""The boys worked their socks off today. To get the goals was obviously nice. We were great from Hugo [Lloris] all the way through. ""We have high standards of ourselves and we've got ourselves in a position where we can really fight for the top four. ""Football's about bouncing back. We can't get too high or too low. The performance today shows we're fighting to the end. Hopefully we can use it as momentum going forward. ""We probably have to learn how to be more consistent in a long season to be in the top four. ""We've got Burnley in midweek - they're fighting for their lives so we know it'll be a tough one."" Kane's opening goal was assisted by Heung-Min Son, the 36th time they have combined for a Premier League goal. It is the joint-most of any pairing in the competition's history, moving them level with ex-Chelsea duo Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard. Asked about his relationship with Son, Kane said: ""We had a lot of preparation obviously. ""We connect really well and have a great understanding off the pitch.

Arsenal's top-four bid over?,"This high-stakes clash was the polar opposite of the encounter between Liverpool and Manchester's other club this weekend. Man City vs Liverpool represents a meeting of two of the game's greatest minds, a masterpiece between the league's title protagonists in a class of their own. By contrast, Goodison Park hosted a festival of the doomed involving two clubs in desperate need of a reset. But Everton are not dead. This was a step in the right direction. It was this month three years ago that they produced arguably their best performance of the Farhad Moshiri era against Manchester United, outclassing them 4-0 to provoke a memorable rebuke from Gary Neville. The defeat exposed all the problems facing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. A fifth successive away defeat for the first time since 1981 would contribute to their failure to qualify for the Champions League. ""I've often said that clubs over the last seven years, if you've got weeds in the garden, then you've got to get rid of them,"" said Neville. ""But there's some Japanese knotweed at that football club and it's attacking the foundations of the house. It needs dealing with properly."" Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Premier League table Premier League fixtures So much has changed and yet so much has stayed the same at United, who look no closer to competing for the big prizes. Despite coming off in the 64th minute, Marcus Rashford attempted more shots at goal (3) and had more touches in the opposition's box (6) than any other player in the match. It is scant consolation for the disgruntled travelling fans but the forward looking a bit more like his old self is a small crumb of comfort that Rangnick can take with him back to Manchester.Ben Grounds Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The beauty of the way Manchester City play football is that they can attack you from all angles. Whether it is Joao Cancelo pinging defence-splitting passes from the left or Raheem Sterling darting in between defenders, you rarely get a moment's peace defending against Pep Guardiola's side. However, there is one constant to the City attacks. The source. The key component that makes the City machine work so efficiently. His name is Kevin De Bruyne. He overpowered and outthought Thiago Alcantara, Fabinho and Jordan Henderson in the Liverpool midfield. City's star man stepped up and delivered inside five minutes when his deflected strike flew in off a post to get the defending champions going. This is the first time in his career he has scored in four consecutive matches in all competitions. He is also on track to break his personal tally of goals in a Premier League season - this being his 11th with his record standing at 13. He had his head in his hands on the half-hour when he hit the side netting, but he repeatedly passed through the Liverpool lines and was very unfortunate not to register an assist for Sterling when he raced through and scored until VAR got involved. The devastating Belgian is in the form of his life. A scary thought when you think he's a back-to-back PFA Player of the Year winner. No player has ever won the award three years on the spin but his end-of-season brilliance could turn the vote away from Mohamed Salah, who has been odds-on favourite for the award for many months now. A potential fourth Premier League title and a third major PFA award would surely send this magnificent footballer to the top of the tree in terms of the greatest player to have played in the Premier League. He might even be there already.Lewis Jones Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Only a couple of weeks ago it felt as though Arsenal were favourites to land fourth place and a long-awaited return to the Champions League. But in the space of six days, their hopes of returning to Europe's top club competition have suffered a significant blow. The defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday Night Football was a bad one. Arsenal, harassed and harried by their London rivals, never got going and made costly mistakes. It was the worst performance they'd served up since the early weeks of the season. A young side is prone to inconsistency, though, and the real issue was not that loss but how they'd respond. The answer Arsenal fans saw on Saturday would have alarmed them. While Brighton didn't bring the same frantic pressing style to the Emirates that Palace showed at Selhurst Park, Arsenal were still slow out of the blocks again, sloppy in possession and disjointed in attack, with the forced reshuffle caused by Thomas Partey's absence and Nuno Tavares' form not working. Gabriel Martinelli was denied an equaliser by a marginal offside call on the stroke of half-time but that would have been harsh on Brighton. Arsenal laboured with the ball and lacked zip or a clear approach, as Mikel Arteta conceded afterwards. It wasn't until Martin Odegaard made it 2-1 in the 89th minute that Arsenal showed the required intensity levels. Twice this week Arsenal have passed up opportunities to go fourth. With injuries, fixtures and points totals now counting against them, Arsenal have it all to do if they are to now overhaul neighbours Tottenham. Come the summer, they may look back on this week as the moment their encouraging season unravelled.Peter Smith Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Heung-Min Son now has 17 Premier League goals this season and in this form might yet rival Mohamed Salah for the golden boot. That connection with Harry Kane looks as lethal as ever, with the England captain's assist for the third goal highlighting his extraordinary vision. But perhaps it is time we talked about this being a magical trio at Tottenham as well as a perfect partnership. Dejan Kulusevski raced through to score from another Kane assist and then turned provider for Son for the fourth goal. The Swede has been a revelation since his arrival. There is not much that Kane and Son lacked but he has added it. A natural left-footer, he knows when to slow the game down as well as speed it up, and that calmness in the final third sets him apart from the other contenders for that third position in the Tottenham attack. Gareth Bale's return to the club on loan from Real Madrid last season had briefly hinted at a dream team of a forward line - and the Welshman did deliver goals. But Kulusevski has been better. This time, it looks like it might be enough to carry Spurs into the Champions League places.Adam Bate Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Within 21 minutes at St Mary's, Chelsea had delivered the response needed of them after two damaging defeats. Marcos Alonso, Mason Mount and Timo Werner had all struck to quickly lay any concerns to rest having been stunned by Brentford 4-1 a week ago and then humbled 3-1 at home by Real Madrid. Thomas Tuchel made four changes from their Champions League quarter-final first-leg defeat with Mateo Kovacic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Timo Werner and Marcos Alonso all put into the team. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The switches helped Chelsea be more aggressive against a Southampton side known for their tenacity. It meant when Chelsea won the ball back quickly, they could counter-attack immediately and capitalise on the space in behind the Southampton defence. The Blues were so good at hustling the Saints midfield that the combative Oriol Romeu was hooked after just 35 minutes having been thoroughly overrun. Kovacic and Ngolo Kante were relentless in their pressure while Loftus-Cheek, despite playing out of position at right-wing back, played a crucial part in Chelsea's physicality, but also in attack by being involved in two goals. Alonso, too, also delivered the important opener with a trademark arrival into the box. Then there was Werner who showed his value after being benched against Madrid with two goals from enough chances to score five, not that it mattered in the end because Chelsea found their sting again.David Richardson Referee Jon Moss finally consented to the baying home crowd. Everton don't know how to win, according to Sean Dyche, but they found a way to hold on despite Manchester United's best efforts to go quietly. This is a poor United side and this abject display spearheaded by the anonymous Cristiano Ronaldo laid bare the size of the task facing Erik ten Hag if he is appointed. But the day and this occasion was about Everton. Richarlison, the tireless Brazilian, embodied Frank Lampard's calls for energy and fight for the cause in response to the second-half capitulation at Burnley. There were Herculean efforts by all those in blue, from Alex Iwobi and Fabián Delph - the unlikely couple - in midfield and of course from Gordon, who has the footballing world at his feet. Jordan Pickford was no bystander, playing his part to twice deny Marcus Rashford and then Ronaldo in stoppage time. This was a backs-to-the-wall performance from Everton, another twist at the bottom and another twist of the knife in United's Champions League hopes. ""I've got to give the lads a lot of credit here having lost twice in a week,"" Frank Lampard said. ""To go again Saturday morning against a team that's fresh and full of quality was excellent. It was joined-up with the fans, it's been good here since I've arrived by that's not a given. The players put the effort in. We've been due one of those, a deflection, something to hang onto. ""I'm pleased for Anthony. He feels it, he's grown up here and he's mature beyond his age. No wonder the fans love him. It's always a team effort and Jordan made two big saves in the first half and an outstanding one at the end. It felt outstanding. His quality makes the save. Jordan is England's No 1 for a reason and he absolutely showed it today."" ""We know it's in our hands, regardless of the others, to stay in the league. Some people around me have been calculating how many more points or wins we need but I'm not focused on that. We just need to keep performing like this."" The Spirit of the Blues plays out and they have never shown so much spirit this season.Ben Grounds ""He's a class act,"" Jamie Carragher said of Bruno Guimaraes after he produced a man-of-the-match display in Newcastle's 1-0 win over Wolves on Friday Night Football. The more the Brazilian plays, the more there is to admire about him. On his first home Premier League start for the Magpies since arriving from Lyon for £40m in January, the midfielder oozed quality from the first minute at St James' Park and deservedly received a standing ovation when he was substituted shortly before the final whistle. The 24-year-old's exquisite backheel volley against Southampton last month showed he possesses world-class attributes and he proved once again why Newcastle made him their most expensive signing so far under new ownership. Completing 37 of 41 passes, winning possession seven times and making four tackles, it was a dominant performance against a Wolves outfit who went into the game still with an outside chance of qualifying for next season's Champions League. Newcastle boss Eddie Howe told Sky Sports Guimaraes gives his side a ""different dimension"". His South American flair does exactly that, but he also has a strong work ethic and combative attitude. Despite last weekend's 5-1 defeat at Tottenham, Newcastle have been transformed under Howe and are now 10 points clear of the relegation zone. They are almost certain to become the first team to avoid the drop after failing to win any of their first 14 games. With safety almost secured, they can now afford to have one eye on building towards what they hope will be an exciting future. Guimaraes is certain to play a starring role.Dan Sansom Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Bruno Lage described Wolves' 1-0 defeat to Newcastle on Friday Night Football as an opportunity missed for his side in their push for European football and it is hard to disagree with him. It was an abysmal first-half display, which Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher said could only get better after the break, but there was minimal improvement in the second 45 minutes. Wolves' approach to sit back and soak up the Newcastle pressure worked for large parts of the first half, but they offered nothing going forward and failed to register a single shot on target until the 81st minute. The absences of Ruben Neves and Leander Dendoncker were sorely felt in midfield with teenager Luke Cundle, making just his second Premier League start, struggling to get to grips with the game as Newcastle's £40m January signing Bruno Guimaraes ran riot. It's a case of 'what if' again for Wolves fans, who will be wondering why their team failed to turn up at St James' Park when a win would have moved them to within two points of fourth-placed Tottenham and up to sixth, albeit momentarily.Zinny Boswell Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There was no sugar coating Roy Hodgson's assessment of Watford's survival hopes after their latest setback at the hands of Leeds. ""We have no reason to be confident,"" the former England boss said after watching his team succumb to a ninth successive Premier League defeat at Vicarage Road. The Hornets became the first Premier League side in a decade to match that unwanted record. The last team to do so, Wolves, were relegated, and it's becoming increasing difficult to see how Hodgson can turn things around and avoid what would be the first top-flight relegation of his illustrious career. As the unlikelihood of Watford hauling themselves out of the mess they find themselves in increases, so too does the improbability of Leeds surrendering the healthy position they have battled themselves into under Jesse Marsch. Three wins in a four-game unbeaten run have transformed the fortunes of the Yorkshire club, who were once staring at the plight now engulfing Watford. Marsch has galvanised a group of players many feared would struggle to adapt to methods other than those of predecessor Marcelo Bielsa. Such fears look incredibly misguided now, with Marsch having surely guided Leeds to another season in the Premier League.Jack Wilkinson Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

The 39-year-old is known for staying cool and composed during his media dealings but on this subject, in a small office at the club's London Colney headquarters, his passion shines through. The atmosphere at the Emirates Stadium, he says, is ""completely different"" from the start of his tenure, when rows of empty seats had come to reflect the general malaise around the club. ""You can feel it,"" Arteta tells Sky Sports. ""You can try to tell people about it, but when you are there, you just feel it, that it's genuine, that it's happening, that there is this interaction of energy and emotions. I feel a real unity between the supporters and the team."" The pandemic proved a significant and unforeseen interruption but Arteta describes building that sense of unity as one of his ""main goals"" following his appointment in December 2019. ""If you had asked me what I wanted to do here, I would have said that I would like to make the Emirates the toughest stadium to play at in England, to create a really unique atmosphere that you feel on your skin when you go there,"" he says. ""An atmosphere where our fans feel, 'I can't wait until Saturday to go and support the team', where people are walking to the Emirates thinking, 'I'm ready, I want to support these guys, they are really worth it, and I feel really engaged with them'. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports Premier League fixtures ""If we can do that, it's going to be a big, big win."" There is work still ahead if the Emirates is to become quite as fearsome as Arteta desires but the progress is already clear. It can be seen in their record - only Liverpool and Manchester City have taken more points than Arsenal in home games this season - and it can be seen in the stands too; in the way supporters stayed behind to show their appreciation after the crushing, stoppage-time defeat to City on New Year's Day; in the way they roared them on to victory against Wolves last week. ""We got that result because of the reaction the fans had straight away [after conceding the opening goal],"" says Arteta of the Wolves game, ""to support the team, to be behind the team, and the energy they created even before our first goal. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""The goal wasn't what provoked that emotion, it was the opposite way around, and that has to be it. 'Can we give something to the team knowing they are going to give it back for sure?'. ""That's where you build special moments."" It helps, of course, that recent results have been so positive, putting Arsenal two points off the Champions League spots with three games in hand on fourth-placed Manchester United. But the make-up of the side is more important to Arteta when it comes to fostering a connection between players and fans. ""I think we have players where generally you can see the feeling they have towards the club,"" he says. ""Obviously, having academy players in the team is something extremely important because you know there is something else there apart from, 'I like to play football, I like to represent a professional football club and earn money here'. ""I think those players are attached to our DNA, to our values. They have been raised here and they appreciate the fact they have been with us for a long, long time. ""That's something I think the fans sense. ""And, with the other players, they just see that they are giving 100 per cent to the club, and when that is the case, I think they have no option..."" Arteta grins. ""They have to support these guys."" The win over Wolves sparked delirious celebrations inside the Emirates, putting Arsenal's top-four destiny firmly in their hands and adding to a growing sense of optimism that they might just do it. But it is only a matter of weeks ago that they were enduring a dismal January, winning none of their five games, crashing out of two cup competitions, and allowing captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to join Barcelona on a free without signing a replacement. The decision to let Aubameyang go in that context left onlookers scratching their heads and left Arteta with two senior strikers in Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah who had only scored three Premier League goals between them all season. And yet, in the Premier League, at least, the team's performances have improved markedly. Arsenal have won seven out of nine games in the competition since Aubameyang was dropped, losing only once. Their attacking output has increased across the board during that time. They are taking more shots and scoring more goals. They are getting more touches in the opposition box and ranking higher for expected goals. Even possession is up. ""I think there are many reasons attached to that,"" says Arteta. ""First of all, the understanding of what we want is clearer. We have a fit squad, without too many disturbances for a long period. ""That has allowed us to play a certain team more regularly and that team now has better cohesion and better understanding. Their qualities fit to make each other better. ""And then, obviously, when you get results, confidence builds up, belief builds up and the rest is a consequence of that."" Has Aubameyang's departure allowed others to shine? ""We always make decisions in the best interests of the club and to get the best performances from the team,"" says Arteta. ""We made that decision as three parties. One was the club, one was Auba, and the other was Barcelona. The three of us believed it was the right thing to do."" As for the decision not to replace him in the same window, a decision which angered many supporters, Arteta says: ""That was a possibility but I think when you have a clear direction and process of how you make your decisions, you have to be ruthless. ""You have to have a certain courage and consistency in those decisions. If one decision is to only bring in players we can afford, who are going to make the team much better straight away, and who are sustainable for our future, then that should be the case. ""So, even if you are tempted to do something, but you think it's going to bring you trouble in the coming months or years, you should not do it. I think we were brave not to do it."" Brave, but not vindicated just yet. ""We did what we had to do and what was our responsibility as people who are managing this football club,"" says Arteta. ""But whether it was good or not, we will only know at the end of the season, and it will depend on whether we have won enough matches."" They will attempt to do that with Lacazette leading the line and while goals continue to prove elusive for the Frenchman, whose late winner against Wolves was ruled as a Jose Sa own goal, Arteta insists he has been instrumental in their recent improvement. ""Laca has a really important quality, which is that he makes the people around him better,"" he says. ""He understands the game really well, he's a really intelligent player and his work-rate is phenomenal. ""I think he's been very unlucky not to score another four, five, six goals in this period. We want to give him the confidence and he will do that but, for me, he scored last week against Wolves. ""He was there to make the final action to win the match."" Aubameyang's exit followed those of Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Folarin Balogun, Pablo Mari, Calum Chambers and Sead Kolasinac either on loan or permanently in January, continuing a drastic overhaul of the squad which has been ongoing throughout Arteta's tenure. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Indeed, of the 18 players involved in his first game in charge, a 1-1 draw with Bournemouth a little over two years ago, only six remain at the club now. First-team departures are well into double figures under the Spaniard and so too are arrivals. ""It's unheard of,"" says Arteta. ""I think it's very difficult to explain externally what it takes to do that, the thinking behind the decisions you have to make and the unpopular decisions you have to make. ""But our responsibility is to look further into the future, to say, 'I want to get here and I have to work backwards from there because this is the aim and if I don't do this now, we are never going to get there'. ""That is very difficult to explain but I think between all of us, starting from the ownership, the board, Edu as our technical director and all the people in between us to make final decisions on the squad, we have been very consistent and very united. ""Because normally, when a turnaround like this happens, there is internal conflict, 100 per cent, because you cannot agree on 36 players in two years - it's impossible."" Has he had any rows with Edu along the way? ""Not rows,"" Arteta says with a smile. ""The good thing is that we have people who say what they think, then go away and work on it and present their reasons why, and that makes other people think. ""And the really important thing is that we decide whatever we decide on this table,"" he says, his palm landing on the surface in front of him, ""then we leave the room, and it's our decision. ""It's not yours or mine, it's our decision and we stick by it - even if we make mistakes."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There have certainly been mistakes along the way - and costly ones at that - but last summer's spending looks increasingly inspired, with Aaron Ramsdale, Ben White, Martin Odegaard and Takehiro Tomiyasu all making huge contributions this season. Will this summer be as important as the last one? ""More important,"" says Arteta. ""I think now is the moment we have to go to a different level. ""We have been able to get the squad balance in a much better shape. Financially, we are in a much more stable position with the money we have spent on certain players touching the pitch for a certain amount of minutes. That balance is much better spread out across the squad. ""And now is the moment to raise the quality."" With Aubameyang gone, and with Lacazette and Nketiah's contracts due to expire at the end of the season, a new striker is sure to be top of the club's agenda. What, though, is Arteta looking for in that position? ""He puts the ball in the net, that's priority number one,"" he says with a grin. ""Goal threat. Any successful team needs enough goal threat in the squad. Without it, you have nothing. You can play good football but you need enough goal threat in the team. ""The other thing is that he has to complement the other people we have, personally and on the pitch, and for that, we need the right profile. ""We need a profile where you can exploit his qualities at the same time as the qualities we already have, so we don't have to transform our way of playing again to adapt to that specific player. ""He has to have a certain age, a certain level of experience, and he has to be able to come here and play under the pressure of being at Arsenal."" The club put the emphasis on youth last summer, with all six of their new arrivals aged 23 or under, but Arteta nods his head when asked if there is more room for manoeuvre on that front now. ""I think now we can be more flexible in the type of recruitment we do because obviously we are the youngest squad in the league right now,"" he says. ""We have to be careful about what is the balance. ""But sometimes, it's not just related to the age because you see players who are 23, 24 but have the career of someone who is 29 because they started really young. ""Then, it's about the personality, the leadership qualities they have at 22, at 24 or at 34, because some players don't have that even at 34. We are sometimes much more focused on that than the age."" One player to whom that feels relevant is Bukayo Saka. The 20-year-old has played more Premier League minutes than any other Arsenal player under Arteta and while he was initially used at wing-back - ""it took me a while to figure him out,"" Arteta said in April of last year - he is now firmly established on the right-hand side of their attack, where he has become a talismanic figure. This season he has continued to flourish. With seven goals and four assists in the Premier League so far, he has already eclipsed his combined total for the whole of the last campaign. ""I think his biggest improvement is the level of consistency he's playing with,"" says Arteta. ""To have moments is fine. A lot of players can do that. But to play consistently at that level is very difficult. ""Opponents know him and people expect a lot of him but he is still as humble, as committed and as hungry as he was when I met him on the first day. ""Now, I think he understands the game much better and I think he also has a different level of aggression as a player which I think was very needed in him."" The manner in which he has embraced the responsibility of being one of Arsenal's most important players has delighted Arteta. ""I'm very pleased and it's very rare, especially for attacking players at big clubs, but he's done that in a natural way because he's shown he can do it, he's doing it, and then he has to flow. ""You don't have to look at him and ask more questions because he's coming from the academy. I think that's a big mistake. He's doing it. If we had paid £70m for him, we would keep playing him, so why would we not do that with an academy player?"" Why not indeed? Arsenal's quest to claim a Champions League spot resumes against Watford at Vicarage Road this Sunday. For Arteta, though, it is just the beginning.

The Champions League quarter-final draw will take place on Friday March 18 at 11am UK time, with the balls being drawn out at UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. The semi-finals will be drawn at the same time, meaning clubs and fans can plot out their potential route to the Paris final.

You will be able to follow all three draws across Sky Sports' digital platforms. Liverpool became the first English team to book their Champions League last-eight spot with a 2-1 aggregate victory over Italian side Inter Milan. They were joined by Bayern Munich, who defeated RB Salzburg via an 8-2 aggregate win. Europa League Fixtures Europa League results Europa Conference League fixtures Europa Conference League results Find out more about Sky Sports Manchester City safely made it through with a 5-0 aggregate win over Sporting Lisbon, while Real Madrid stunned PSG with a 3-2 aggregate victory. Real's city rivals Atletico also made it through by knocking out Manchester United 2-1 on aggregate, with Benfica also in the last eight after beating Ajax 3-2 on aggregate. On Wednesday, the final two teams were confirmed as Chelsea saw off Lille 4-1 on aggregate, while Villarreal beat Juventus by the same scoreline. The list of qualified teams are: Liverpool Six-times winners Liverpool signalled their intent with a perfect six wins out of six to top Group B and disposed of Serie A champions Inter Milan in the last 16 following an impressive 2-0 first leg victory at the San Siro. The 1-0 reverse in the return at Anfield is their only defeat in 18 matches in all competitions dating back to the turn of the year, and Wednesday night's 2-0 win at Arsenal, in which Diogo Jota scored his 13th Premier League goal of the campaign - a tally bettered only by team-mate Mohamed Salah - took them to within a point of leaders Manchester City. Bayern Munich Like the Reds, Bayern have been crowned European champions on six occasions, most recently in 2020, and their progression to the last 16 from Group E was similarly flawless and yielded 22 goals, nine of them from star striker Robert Lewandowski. The Poland international helped himself to a hat-trick in an 8-2 aggregate win over RB Salzburg in the last 16 which was secured by a 7-1 second-leg victory for the Bundesliga leaders. Real Madrid No club has lifted the trophy on more occasions than Real Madrid, and although it is four years since their 13th triumph, their current run of form suggests they are in the mood to end that mini-drought. Only a shock 2-1 home defeat by Moldovan champions Sheriff Tiraspol denied Real a perfect Group D campaign and their ruthless 3-1 second-leg dismissal of Paris St Germain, which was secured by Karim Benzema's hat-trick, saw the runaway LaLiga leaders send an ominous message to their rivals. Manchester City The Champions League is the big prize missing from Pep Guardiola's Manchester City CV - he won it twice with Barcelona - and the club's desire to add its name to an honour roll on which neighbours United feature three times remains undimmed. The Premier League leaders finished top of Group A despite losing at Paris St Germain and RB Leipzig, but trounced Sporting Lisbon 5-0 in Portugal as they cruised into the last eight. Atletico Madrid Diego Simeone's men were laboured in their efforts to make the knockout stage with the three-times runners-up winning only two of their Group B games to finish a distant second to Liverpool. However, Renan Lodi's first-half header at Old Trafford proved sufficient to end Manchester United's involvement in the competition and a squad which includes renowned keeper Jan Oblak, Portugal striker Joao Felix and Liverpool and Barcelona old boy Luis Suarez should not be written off.

They lost heavily to Bayern Munich home and away, but edged Barcelona into third place in Group E due in large part to a famous 3-0 home win over the Catalan giants, and a side including Jan Vertonghen, Nicolas Otamendi and Adel Taarabt booked its place in the last eight with a 3-2 aggregate victory over Ajax. Villarreal Villarreal were one of five Spanish sides to set out in the competition and are among three survivors after finishing just a point behind Manchester United - the side they beat 11-10 on penalties in Gdansk in last season's Europa League final to clinch their place in the competition - in Group F. Currently sitting in seventh place in La Liga and 21 points behind leaders Real Madrid, they made it to the quarter-finals after a stunning 3-0 second-leg win over Juventus in Turin, scoring all three goals inside the final 12 minutes. Chelsea Since adding the Club World Cup to their Champions League crown, in February, Chelsea have been plunged into uncertainty by the sanctions imposed upon owner Roman Abramovich in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On the pitch, however, they have soldiered on remarkably under the hugely impressive Thomas Tuchel - they are unbeaten in 13 outings in all competitions - emerging from Group H as runners-up behind Juventus following a costly 3-3 draw at Zenit St Petersburg in their final fixture before dispensing comfortably with French side Lille.

Ander Herrera dedicated Manchester United's Europa League victory to the victims of Monday's terrorist attack. Paul Pogba's deflected strike in the 18th minute and Henrikh Mkhitaryan's close-range goal (48) secured United's second trophy of the season and a result which may offer some joy to the city of Manchester following a devastating week. Victory also earns the club a place in next season's Champions League group stage and justifies the decision of manager Jose Mourinho to prioritise this competition in recent months. The celebrations of the fans and players at the full-time whistle were, however, tempered by thoughts of the terrorist attack at Manchester Arena on Monday evening, which prompted heightened security at the Friends Arena and a sombre build-up to the showpiece match. Many supporters carried signs in tribute to the victims of the tragedy and there were chants of 'Manchester, Manchester' following a period of silence ahead of kick-off. Pogba, who was playing less than two weeks after the death of his father, almost rewarded those travelling supporters inside the first minute, but shot narrowly wide from distance. But the world's most expensive player only had to wait until the 18th minute for the breakthrough, which followed a terrible throw-in from Jairo Riedewald, presenting the ball to Juan Mata in a dangerous area. United rise to the occasion Man Utd player ratings What next for United? Rooney to miss England squad Just a game but Jose Mourinho and Man Utd delivered under some pressure in Stockholm. The ball was worked to Pogba, via Marouane Fellaini, and the Frenchman's 20-yard shot took a wicked deflection off the knee of Davinson Sanchez giving wrong-footed goalkeeper Andre Onana no chance of keeping it out. It was a cruel moment for Ajax, but the goal was a just reward for a dominant, controlled first-half display from United and they might have doubled their advantage when captain Antonio Valencia's fine run and shot from a tight angle forced Onana to beat the ball away. But the second goal arrived just three minutes into the second half and it came from another of Mourinho's summer signings following a Mata corner. Chris Smalling nodded the ball down for Mkhitaryan inside the six-yard box and the Armenian leapt to hook the ball past Onana, sparking vigorous celebrations and more 'Manchester' chants. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The goal was a bitter blow for an Ajax team with an average age of just over 22 who rarely threatened Sergio Romero - and things might have gotten worse when Fellaini headed Pogba's cross straight at the goalkeeper or when substitute Jesse Lingard was denied by a last-ditch Sanchez tackle in the closing minutes. Club captain Wayne Rooney was introduced from the bench in the 89th minute for what might prove to be a farewell appearance, as United held on to add the Europa League to the EFL Cup they won in February and ensure there will be five Premier League teams playing in the Champions League next season. The success means they become the fifth club in history to have won all three major European trophies, but more importantly, could bring a smile to some supporters in a heartbreaking week for their city.

United have confirmed Solskjaer's assistant Michael Carrick will be placed in temporary charge, with the club also revealing their intention to appoint an interim manager until the end of the season. Pochettino is the club's first choice as Solskjaer's permanent replacement, with the former Tottenham manager potentially becoming more attainable by the summer than he is currently. Ajax head coach Erik ten Hag is understood to be United's second choice. Solskjaer signed a new three-year deal in July but leaves after overseeing five defeats in their last seven Premier League matches - a run which sees them 12 points behind leaders Chelsea. The Old Trafford hierarchy had ignored increasingly vociferous calls to relieve Solskjaer of his duties in the wake of a humiliating 5-0 loss to rivals Liverpool and a 2-0 derby defeat to Manchester City in early November. But his position was discussed by United officials on Saturday evening following the crushing defeat at Vicarage Road, before the announcement of his dismissal followed on Sunday morning. A club statement said: ""Manchester United announces that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has left his role as manager. Transfer Centre: Who next for Man Utd? Analysis: What went wrong for Solskjaer? Man Utd fixtures Premier League table Get Sky Sports ""Ole will always be a legend at Manchester United and it is with regret that we have reached this difficult decision. While the past few weeks have been disappointing, they should not obscure all the work he has done over the past three years to rebuild the foundations for long-term success."" Pochettino was heavily linked with United following his sacking by Spurs in November 2019, but eventually joined PSG in January 2021. His side are currently 12 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 and on course to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League. Pochettino signed an 18-month contract when he joined PSG but there was an option for an extra year which the French club have since activated. He is currently living in a hotel in Paris while his family still lives in north London. It is understood that Ajax would not entertain the idea of allowing Ten Hag - who is contracted until 2023 - to leave them mid-season, but Sky Sports News has been told the Dutchman would ""100 per cent be interested in the job"" come the summer. The United hierarchy believed Solskjaer had earned the chance to turn around his side's slump, but the chastening nature of Saturday's defeat made it clear to them change was needed. Following a second-placed finish in the Premier League last season and the summer signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho, United chiefs expected to see further progress this campaign. The club are satisfied Solskjaer has left them in a far stronger position than when he took over in December 2018, with their recent appointments of Darren Fletcher as technical director and John Murtough as football director considered to be crucial in minimising the disruption of a mid-season managerial change. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player United added: ""Ole leaves with our sincerest thanks for his tireless efforts as manager and our very best wishes for the future. His place in the club's history will always be secure, not just for his story as a player, but as a great man and a manager who gave us many great moments. He will forever be welcome back at Old Trafford as part of the Manchester United family."" Solskjaer was booed by a number of the United fans in the away end at full time at Watford, although midfielder Bruno Fernandes appeared to try to redirect their frustration towards the players. Goalkeeper David de Gea labelled the defeat ""embarrassing"" and ""unacceptable"". After the game, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher described Solskjaer's position as ""untenable"" but described the performance of the club's players as ""scandalous"". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  United forward Ronaldo is understood to be keen for Spain head coach Luis Enrique to take over at Old Trafford. Enrique, who won the treble with Barcelona in 2015, is expected to be one of several candidates placed under consideration to replace Solskajer. It is thought Enrique would be interested in talking to officials about the vacancy, and he is understood to have the backing of Ronaldo, who thinks he is the right calibre of coach to enable United to compete with Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea. With United looking to appoint an interim boss until the end of the season before finding a permanent manager in the summer, the club's and Enrique's timeframes would need to align. Spain last week secured qualification for next year's World Cup, and it remains to be seen whether Enrique would leave the role just months before the tournament, which begins in November 2022. Former United striker Solskjaer returned to the club initially as caretaker manager after the dismissal of Jose Mourinho in December 2018 and immediately produced an upturn in United's form - including the 3-1 win at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. 'Ole's at the wheel' became a trending topic as Solskjaer was appointed on a permanent basis in March 2019. He was unable to lead United into the top four of the Premier League that season but did achieve third and second-place finishes in his two full seasons in charge. However, Solskjaer failed to deliver silverware during his tenure, with the defeat on penalties to Villarreal in last season's Europa League final being their best effort. Sky Sports' Gary Neville reflects on Solskjaer's dismissal: He has always had that result in the past that has pulled him out of the mire when you thought it might get a little bit too tricky for him. But this time the results have just got worse and worse. The worst thing has been the performances. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Yesterday, some of the defending is absolutely woeful, the goalkeeper, the defenders. It is a back four or back five that have played together a number of times and Watford are not the best team in the league by a long stretch. They mauled Manchester United. Ole could not get a performance out of them in the end. The players looked drained of confidence. I am not surprised today that it has ended. The worst thing for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would have been if he had become a bridge for a dark period in the club. Hopefully, it will be a bright future. They need to get the next appointment right. Maybe that will be at the end of the season. Peter Schmeichel tells Sky Sports he feels ""really sorry"" for his former clubmate Solskjaer in the wake of his sacking. It is a very, very sad day. It's the fourth time now [since Sir Alex Ferguson left] that we've had to sack a manager. Clearly something is not going right at the club, so hopefully the fifth time they can get the club better organised and get the right person in. I just feel really, really sorry for Ole because I actually think he has done a really good job. We only see what happens on the pitch, but what he has had to do is deal with a lot of issues and work with a very big squad that he hasn't picked. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  I thought he did fantastically behind the scenes and trying to organise what a club should be. There isn't a lot of time for managers these days and hopefully Ole can bounce back and hopefully he is okay. I want Manchester United to get back to being a winning club, I don't want a manager that wins one trophy and he's away two years later. I want somebody who is going to compete for the Premier League and Champions League every year and build the club up. I want someone who is going to be there for the long-term, someone who sees into the future and who is going to work with the academy and are prepared to wait six years for somebody to break into the first team, who has a big enough network to pick the best players and bring that Manchester United DNA back. I have to say that Ole was on his way to doing that. The Norwegian departs Manchester United with an inferior win percentage to that of Jose Mourinho, the man he replaced. Here, we take a look at the numbers... Saturday's defeat to Watford was Solskjaer's 168th game in charge of the club. In total, he won 91 of them, drawing 37 and losing 40. Of Manchester United's four permanent managers since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure from the club, including David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho as well as Solskjaer, the Norwegian's overall win rate of 54 per cent puts him second. Mourinho's win rate is the highest of the four at 58 per cent, while Moyes and Van Gaal trail on 53 per cent and 52 per cent respectively. Overall, Solskjaer's record against the traditional big-six - Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham - was mixed, with 14 wins, 10 draws and 12 losses. Indeed, a big-six mini-league of head-to-head meetings since Solskjaer's appointment puts Manchester United 18 points behind City and 23 behind Liverpool. That, of course, is despite heavy investment in the squad. This summer, Manchester United brought in Cristiano Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane at considerable expense. Their latest round of spending pushed their net spend under Solskjaer to £312m - £33m more than any other Premier League side and £196m more than City and Liverpool's combined. Manchester United have long been lavish spenders in the transfer market but they have now invested more under Solskjaer (£441m) than they did under Mourinho (£430.8m) or Van Gaal (£309.2m). Manchester United will now pin their hopes on a new manager to restore their former glories.

The 63-year-old's contract will see him take charge of the first team until June and then remain at the club for at least a further two years in a consultancy role. United reached an agreement with Lokomotiv Moscow last week for the release of Rangnick, who was manager of sports and development at the Russian club. He will take the reins from Michael Carrick, who was in temporary charge of the team for last week's 2-0 Champions League win over Villarreal and Sunday's 1-1 draw at Chelsea in the Premier League following the dismissal of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. However, Carrick will remain in charge for Thursday's home game against Arsenal if Rangnick's work permit is not processed in time. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Rangnick told United's website following his appointment: ""I am excited to be joining Manchester United and focused on making this a successful season for the club. ""The squad is full of talent and has a great balance of youth and experience. All my efforts for the next six months will be on helping these players fulfil their potential, both individually and, most importantly, as a team. Why Rangnick is in demand Rangnick has tools to work with Man Utd fixtures Get Sky Sports ""Beyond that, I look forward to supporting the club's longer-term goals on a consultancy basis."" John Murtough, the football director at United, added: ""Ralf is one of the most respected coaches and innovators in European football. ""He was our number one candidate for interim manager, reflecting the invaluable leadership and technical skills he will bring from almost four decades of experience in management and coaching. ""Everyone at the club is looking forward to working with him during the season ahead, and then for a further two years in his advisory role."" Rangnick will be joined at United by a small number of his own staff, while those working under Solskjaer will remain as part of the new regime. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Rangnick oversaw the rise of the Red Bull group of clubs in Europe as head coach and sporting director of RB Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg. The German is credited with having influenced Jurgen Klopp, Thomas Tuchel and Julian Nagelsmann, among many others. Rangnick invented the 'gegenpress', which translates as 'counter-press'; the high-pressing, all-out running style adopted to great fame by the current Liverpool boss Klopp. He is understood to have been respected by senior figures at Old Trafford for a number of years and was quickly identified as United's first choice to replace Solskjaer on an interim basis. That impression was reinforced during talks with Murtough, as well as Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, and Darren Fletcher, the technical director. Murtough has a prior relationship with Rangnick having visited him during his time at RB Leipzig in 2019. At the age of 63, Rangnick's appointment at United will be the first time he has managed outside of Germany. It has also been more than two years since he worked as a head coach, with his most recent job seeing him guide RB Leipzig to third place in the Bundesliga and a place in the German Cup final during the 2018/19 season. Rangnick also has limited experience in the Champions League, having taken charge of just 10 matches in the competition during his two spells in charge of Schalke. His most recent Champions League game was at Old Trafford, when his Schalke side fell to a 4-1 defeat in the second leg of their semi-final against Manchester United in May 2011. United are planning to make a permanent appointment at the end of the season. Paris Saint-Germain boss Mauricio Pochettino is their first choice, with Ajax head coach Erik ten Hag also in their thinking. Solskjaer was sacked following United's 4-1 defeat at Watford on November 20 after just under three years in charge.

Ralf Rangnick has not taken charge yet - his first game as interim manager is likely to be Thursday's meeting with Arsenal - but the way in which Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Bruno Fernandes sprinted towards the blue-shirted defenders in possession showed his influence may already have taken hold.

""Top-level football is played like that and Manchester United were a million miles away from that. ""Rangnick is coming in now to make sure that Manchester United get back into the Champions League for next season. ""But Rangnick's biggest job is identifying the next coach.

I don't think there was any plan. They didn't think in their wildest dreams it was going to end up like that at Watford. At 2-1, I think he's still in charge come Sunday. I think they were going to keep it going as long as they could. ""Now, to bring in a manager… I'm hearing people going how great he is - but he's never managed in England, he's never managed one of the top teams in the world. Why is that? Why has no one else come in for him when managers have been up? ""I hear great things about him, people saying he's going to press and he's hard working and he's turned lesser teams into real contenders.

It was five years ago to the very week when Palace recorded their last home win over the Gunners. Indeed, it is only their fourth victory over their London neighbours in 26 meetings - but this result was on the cards from the first whistle. Mikel Arteta did not try to sugarcoat things in his assessment of his team's display in south London, apologising to the travelling supporters for this limp performance which gives their Champions League rivals Tottenham, Manchester United and West Ham plenty of hope heading into the remaining games. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Wayne Rooney said on Monday Night Football: ""The fans can see what happened so there was no point in Mikel coming out and trying to dress things up because it wasn't good enough. He has to accept the result and move on but I'm sure he'll be showing clips back to his players of how to get better. ""They are some young players in the squad who have to learn ahead of some big games coming up."" Arsenal never got going. There was a lack of intensity and movement in the final third in the opening exchanges and by half-time against a well-organised Palace, the damage had been done. Premier League table Watch Premier League highlights Live football on Sky Sports Get Sky Sports Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There were chances in the second period for the Gunners, with Eddie Nketiah striking the crossbar and both Martin Odegaard and Emile Smith Rowe missing presentable opportunities but this defeat dents their top-four hopes. Results over the weekend had seen Arsenal leapfrogged by rivals Tottenham in the race for Champions League qualification and they were unable to respond on a night to forget for Arteta's men. As Jamie Carragher pointed out, 15 points from their last 18 on the road means now is not the time to panic, but with news of a decisive north London derby announced for May 12, live on Sky Sports, Arsenal need to remain in the hunt before then.Ben Grounds While there was no rhythm to Arsenal, this was arguably Crystal Palace's best display yet under Patrick Vieira. The Frenchman was delighted to secure a home league win for the first time since December 28 and Palace's second in their last 18 Premier League London derby matches. Cheered on under the lights by the usual din from the Homesdale Road Stand, there was a routineness in truth to this success, which propels Palace into the top half of the Premier League. It has felt like their forward players have taken it in turns to carry the fight this campaign. Christian Benteke and Odsonne Edouard have had their spells as the focal points to attacks, Jordan Ayew - who scored his fourth Premier League goal against Arsenal - has also been in and out of the team while Wilfried Zaha has been the one constant. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Here, Palace were without Michael Olise but the absence of the promising winger was not felt, such is the depth Vieira can now call upon. The latest player to thrive under his tutelage is Jean-Philippe Mateta, who has now scored three goals in his last five Premier League appearances for Palace, one more than he managed in his previous 17 for the Eagles. ""The energy Jean-Philippe brings to the team allows others behind him to do the same,"" Vieira told Sky Sports. ""It forces players behind to follow. He is a massive player. A lot of people will talk about the goal he scored but the passion and work-rate he shows every day is a huge plus for the team."" Ninth position could be the height of Palace's ambitions in the Premier League in their final eight games - given they sit 12 points behind Wolves in eighth place. But with an FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea on the horizon, Vieira's players are fighting to feature at Wembley - and Mateta looks primed for a start on this evidence.Ben Grounds Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Jarrod Bowen's return could not have been timelier for West Ham. Making his first start in a month after four games out injured, Bowen proved to be the difference in the 2-1 home win over Everton. He won the free-kick that resulted in Aaron Cresswell curling in West Ham's opener and then he scored the winner. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It was a reminder to everyone why he had looked nailed on to earn his first England call-up for last month's squad, before agonisingly picking up a foot injury in the defeat at Liverpool. But Hammers boss David Moyes has no doubts Bowen will still be in England manager Gareth Southgate's thoughts come the summer. ""If he finishes the season well then he will be back in contention for those [England] games in June,"" Moyes said. Such is Moyes' trust in Bowen, he had no problem in fast-tracking the forward into the starting XI against Everton after Manuel Lanzini did not make the squad following a car crash on Thursday, which thankfully saw the Argentine unharmed. ""It was only really until yesterday when I knew Lanzini wasn't going to make it,"" Moyes revealed. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I thought with [not having] Lanzini's quality on the ball, and he's played really well for us, do we start Jarrod for 50 or 60 minutes or bring him on for 30 minutes? Because I don't think he's quite all there yet. It's not his fitness, I think it's just his game, and he was a bit worried about it."" But there was nothing concerning about the 25-year-old's performance against Everton, as he lasted 70 minutes before being substituted. Moyes added: ""I have never really been that worried about Jarrod. He said he didn't know if he would be sharp enough when you've been out for a while but he's got such high standards now."" But what would have delighted Moyes the most about Bowen's display is the way he immediately integrated into the side as he formed a threatening quartet with Pablo Fornals, Said Benrahma and Michail Antonio. Together they terrorised the Everton defence all afternoon as they combined for nine shots on goal and between them had 20 of West Ham's 22 touches in the opposition box. Even if Lanzini does return, it is difficult to see Moyes changing that front four for Thursday's huge Europa League quarter-final first leg against Lyon at the London Stadium. One thing is for sure, Bowen's return will have the French side worried.Declan Olley Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Lucas Moura and Steven Bergwijn stepped off the bench to combine for Tottenham's fifth in their thrashing of Newcastle. It was a reminder of the quality Antonio Conte has to call upon and the Italian made a point of highlighting the options those two players in particular give him. But they're being kept out of the side by a brilliant 21-year-old right now. Dejan Kulusevski has made a mockery of suggestions it takes time to adapt to the Premier League. The January loan signing's cross for Heung-Min Son's goal on Sunday made it five assists in his first 10 appearances in this competition. The last player to reach that tally so quickly at his age or younger was a certain Eden Hazard. It would be a big call to say he's on a similar path to the brilliant Belgian but Conte is convinced Spurs have brought in a gem of their own. ""For Tottenham this is a great signing for the present and future,"" he said in his post-match press conference. Spurs have a two-year agreement with Juventus for Kulusevski and an obligation to buy at the end of it if certain criteria are met. Right now that seems like a done deal. The skill, pace and effectiveness he brings in the final third is hard to find - especially at such a young age. While Conte has spoken about the improvement every player has made through his coaching, there's no doubt the arrival of Kulusevski has given the team a boost too. His link-up play with Son and Harry Kane is so fluid. Rodrigo Bentancur signing, also from Juventus, is another key transfer in terms of Tottenham's revival. Conte says the pair have made Spurs more 'complete'. If they can sign a couple more of that standard in the summer, they really will be going places.Peter Smith Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The misery continues for Everton. Bowen inflicted more away-day pain for Frank Lampard's side but here they were the authors of their own downfall, beaten by their own lapse in concentration before the red mist descended. Michael Keane captained the side in the absence of Seamus Coleman but it was his tired challenge on Michail Antonio which made life more difficult moments after West Ham had regained the lead. The Merseysiders have received a red card in each of their last three Premier League matches (including Jonjoe Kenny vs Wolves, Allan vs Newcastle) becoming the first side to see red in three games in a row since Watford in December 2017. Lampard had questioned his players' bottle - or words to that effect - after they capitulated at Crystal Palace in the FA Cup last time out, and they conceded poorly again just five minutes after equalising when Bowen struck. Keane's second yellow card capped another miserable road trip for Lampard, and he simply cannot afford yet another fruitless jaunt away from Goodison Park on Wednesday in that crucial game against Burnley at Turf Moor, live on Sky Sports. Lampard said: ""The next game is always the most important and the next one is a competitor down in the same end of the table. Nobody gets an easy game at Burnley - it's a fact at all times so it's about continuing the application and character of our performance today."" Everton remain safe, for now, but defeat to Sean Dyche's side would close the gap to the bottom three to just a point. As Richarlison trudged disconsolately down the tunnel, Lampard must pull his troops together for the battle that lies ahead.Ben Grounds Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Up until being withdrawn with 20 minutes to play in Newcastle's defeat to Tottenham, Chris Wood had played every minute of every game for the Toon since joining from Burnley. He has been Eddie Howe's focal point without finding the back of the net at a regular rate. Far from it in fact, scoring just one goal. That's fine when you are winning games and team-mates are chipping in with goals. However, Newcastle have now lost three games on the spin and Wood was anonymous in north London, marked out of the game by a combination of Eric Dier and Christian Romero. He had just 15 touches, the lowest by any outfield player who started the game. If you stretch it back further, he only has found the net once in his last 17 starts for Burnley and Newcastle. Sharing the goals around in the absence of Callum Wilson, who is their top scorer with 10 goals, remains a big problem for Howe. Wood is a massive presence but his lack of movement does make it easy to mark him when you don't get players around him. What are the options then? Dwight Gayle remains a Newcastle player but has played just 29 minutes of football in a season of bench warming and hasn't started a Premier League game for almost a year. Yet, his skillset of quick movement and a natural ability to find space in the box might be worth considering in the next few weeks. So, is Howe thinking about going in a different direction? No, it seems, judging by his post-match comments. He said: ""It was a difficult one for Chris, he's had four games [on international duty], a lot of travelling, that's why we withdrew him to keep him in good condition."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The greatest day in Brentford's history? Possibly. The best performance of the season? It can't be far off. But however you categorise Brentford's shocking, stunning 4-1 win at Chelsea there's no denying Thomas Frank and his players deserve huge credit for pulling off a result few would have thought possible. Before kick-off, it seemed Brentford's Premier League survival was more likely to rest on a clash with Watford in a couple of weeks' time. Instead their first league win at west London rivals Chelsea in 83 years may just have secured their status in the top flight. If so, it's an achievement which owes everything to the key ingredients which set this Brentford team apart. First there is the manager, whose surprise switch to a back three caught out the world and European champions. His high-quality coaching has created a team able to mix a high press and a low block and frustrate their opponents with both. Credit to these players, too: from the bravery to take the game to Chelsea early on, to the character to respond to Antonio Rudiger's stunner and push for more. As Frank says, this is a unique group. And then there is Christian Eriksen, who has written another chapter in his wonderful comeback from the cardiac arrest he survived last summer. A first Premier League goal since 2019 was reward for another classy display in the middle of the park. He has inspired the players around him. Capturing the enormity of Saturday's win isn't easy to do - but Brentford supporters will treasure an unforgettable day.Peter Smith Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Thomas Tuchel was at a loss to explain Chelsea's 4-1 home defeat to Brentford. Fatigue from the international break? A lack of preparation time? Goalkeeper Edouard Mendy jaded from the huge effort to help Senegal to the World Cup? Even a change in the weather was suggested. In the end, he put it down to a ""strange 10 minutes"" and said he wouldn't dwell too long on it. It seems a sensible approach because whatever went wrong, Chelsea must shake it off and regain their focus. Their players have admirably continued to deliver despite all the distractions off the pitch in the past month. But April is crucial to their season. On Wednesday Real Madrid are in town for the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final. There is also an FA Cup semi-final to come against Crystal Palace and, later in the month, a potentially pivotal midweek match with Arsenal, the side now breathing down their neck in the Premier League table. A similar defeat to West Brom almost a year ago to the day proved to be just a blip. Tuchel and Chelsea supporters hope that this loss to Brentford will ultimately act as a jolt to sharpen the side up for the big challenges ahead.Peter Smith Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Two hours and 30 minutes. That's how long Liverpool's lead at the top of the Premier League table lasted, but three months ago the Reds would never have dreamed of having a second at the summit. They were 14 points behind Manchester City on January 15. At 2.22pm on Saturday they had moved two points ahead of the champions. At 4.52pm City swiftly re-took top spot with a comfortable win at Burnley, but for Liverpool it was all about starting a massive month with the right result that perfectly tees up next Sunday's potential title-decider at City, live on Sky Sports. Liverpool's win over Watford was a case of job done and move on, as Jurgen Klopp's side laboured to a 2-0 victory over the relegation strugglers. It was not a display worthy of Klopp's 250th Premier League game in charge, and the German admitted afterwards he was ""not interested"" in the performance. ""We didn't play the best football possible today but it was enough,"" he said. ""I didn't expect we would be flying - it is unlikely after the international break it will be the best game of the season."" But he knows his side will have to turn it on in the coming weeks and produce their very best. On Tuesday they go to Lisbon to take on Benfica in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final followed by Sunday's trip to the Etihad. The second leg against Benfica at Anfield is on April 13, before another match against City as they play Pep Guardiola's side in the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley on April 16. That is followed by home league matches against Manchester United on April 19 and Everton on April 24 - both live on Sky Sports. Throw in a potential Champions League semi-final first leg against either Bayern Munich or Villarreal on April 26 or 27, and it really is a blockbuster month for the Reds. The win over Watford will be a minor footnote, but it is a victory that sets up Klopp's side for a pivotal few weeks ahead.Declan Olley Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  James Maddison watched on as Gareth Southgate opted to selected the likes of Emile Smith Rowe and Conor Gallagher for England's international friendlies last month, but the Liecester midfielder provided the perfect response at Old Trafford. The 25-year-old has just one cap for his country to his name, coming as a substitute in a 7-0 win over Montenegro in November 2019, but he created twice as many chances as any other player during Saturday evening's 1-1 draw. On his World Cup ambitions, Maddison said: ""As an English player, the World Cup is the pinnacle. I always think what I can do better to get into the squad. All I can do is keep playing the way I'm playing. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's just about showing more consistency and affecting games more. My numbers have always been good, it's just about finding the consistency. I'm feeling really good, really confident, and I'm going into games with that confidence."" Maddison admitted to struggling with self-confidence following a hip injury, and he could not rediscover top form immediately on his return. But the zip is back now. His cross with his weaker foot for Kelechi Iheanacho to score was sublime, and his confident finish chalked off by VAR would have capped a personal triumph. With Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford still toiling in their search for a spark when sharing the same pitch, Southgate may not be able to ignore the undoubted qualities, and that little bit of something different, that Maddison certainly possesses.Ben Grounds Burnley moved away from their trademark 4-4-2 formation for just the third time in the Premier League this season, with Dyche's plan to ""control"" Man City seeing Jack Cork starting in place of Maxwel Cornet in a bid to beef up the midfield, but the manager admitted his game plan was undone within five minutes thanks to De Bruyne's early goal. In truth, the chances of a home win over the champions were slim regardless of Dyche's tactics, given Pep Guardiola's team's regular dominance of the Clarets, but starting with Wout Weghorst as a lone striker seemed particularly negative. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The giant Dutchman is undoubtedly a threat to opposition defences, but launching long balls towards him without anyone there to attack the second balls was a curious tactic that saw Burnley record just three touches in the opposition box in the first half. Dyche appeared to acknowledge the issue in the second half, bringing on both Cornet and Jay Rodriguez and moving Josh Brownhill into a more advanced position, but it was too little too late, particularly against a Man City side that have not dropped a point from winning positions in the Premier League this season. Weghorst ended the game with zero shots, zero touches in the opposition box and fewer than 50 per cent of his aerial duels won, which outlined the toothless nature of a Burnley attack that relied on his prowess in the air. With just 10 games remaining for Burnley to make up a four-point gap on Everton - who have a game in hand - the onus is on Dyche to get more from January signing Weghorst, who was brought in to help stave off relegation but now has just one goal in 10 league games.Joe Shread Pep Guardiola said before Manchester City's game at Burnley that he and his players were aware they had been knocked off top spot by Liverpool's win over Watford in the early game. But the manager and his players could not have asked for a kinder fixture to allow them to return to the top of the standings, with Man City having won the previous nine games against Burnley by an aggregate score of 32-1. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Clarets lined up in a 4-5-1 formation in a bid to frustrate their visitors, but Man City quickly undermined that strategy thanks to Raheem Sterling's raids down the right wing, and smart finishes from Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gundogan. While Guardiola highlighted his side's inability to kill off the game, he would probably admit in private that his players lowered their intensity in the second half, with the three points all but secure and a formidable fixture list looming. The impressive De Bruyne and Phil Foden were withdrawn in the second period in what seemed to be an attempt to keep them fresh for Tuesday's visit of Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. Man City then face the biggest game of their season to date on April 10 when Liverpool travel to the Etihad - live on Sky Sports­ - before flying to Madrid for their second leg against Atletico. They then take on Liverpool again, this time at Wembley for a place in the FA Cup final. With so many season-defining games taking place in the coming weeks, a trip to Turf Moor seemed to present the perfect tune-up opportunity for Man City - an opportunity the champions emphatically took.Joe Shread Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Wolves had lost four of their previous six Premier League games before their deserved 2-1 derby victory over Aston Villa at Molineux. Having thrown away a 2-0 lead against Leeds to lose 3-2 in their last match before the international break, it looked as if an impressive debut season under head coach Bruno Lage was in danger of petering out. But despite missing the banned Raul Jimenez and injured Ruben Neves, Saturday's win over their west Midlands rivals - as well as inconsistent results from the teams around them - mean they are still firmly in the hunt for European football. Now above West Ham ahead of their clash with Everton on Sunday, live on Sky Sports, Wolves will qualify for next season's Europa Conference League if they can stay in seventh spot - that's if Crystal Palace fail to win the FA Cup. With tough games against Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool remaining, fixtures against Newcastle, Burnley, Brighton and Norwich will give Lage encouragement his side can finish the campaign strongly. After reaching the Europa League quarter-finals in 2019/20 under former boss Nuno Espirito Santo, Wolves can dream of playing in Europe once more and if they can find some consistency during the run-in, they will be well on course to achieve it.Dan Sansom Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  That is a question you'd have answered with a resounding no a few months ago as Graham Potter's side looked certain for a top-10 finish. However, no wins in their last seven games and just three victories in their last 24 league matches have very much derailed their season. It is perhaps a bit of a reality check for a club that don't spend the same type of money in the transfer market as teams around them in the Premier League. In fact, fending off relegation with their small budget is an achievement that should not be underestimated. One thing is for certain, and this has been said before, they need to find a striker that can be relied upon throughout the season. Neal Maupay has shown in spurts what he can do but this performance was another reminder of where Brighton need to invest in the summer. Along with his penalty miss, there were two other very appealing chances that Maupay snatched at. Brighton are now only one point better off than at the same stage of last season when they were 16th with 33 points. Chances and attractive football are being created and served up but this was another day where it was same old story. And they may have even taken it to another level by registering 31 shots without scoring. Only Manchester City have managed to produce that many in one game this season and they won that match 7-0 against Leeds. The problem is so obvious.Lewis Jones Is there a better free-kick taker in world football at present than Southampton skipper James Ward-Prowse? If there is, he must be hiding somewhere. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The England international added to his already bulging repertoire of stunning free-kick goals to earn his side a point at Elland Road on Saturday. When referee Anthony Taylor awarded the visitors a free-kick on the left edge of the area, everyone in the ground knew what was about to come, including Leeds goalkeeper Illan Meslier. However, it is one thing knowing what is coming, and an altogether different proposition stopping it. The Frenchman found that out seconds later, picking the ball out of the net after Ward-Prowse's curling free kick sailed up and over the wall and into the top left-hand corner of the net. Incredibly, that is now the midfielder's 13th direct free-kick in the Premier League, leaving him just five behind David Beckham at the top of the list and with time on his side to catch the former England skipper.Richard Morgan Do not miss your chance to land the £250,000 in Tuesday's Super 6 round.

Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: ""The early kick-off is the last game you really want after an international break. Jurgen Klopp has had players all over the world in the last week so we'll have to wait until Friday to get the medical report from the Liverpool boss. ""The south American contingent were still in action in the early hours of Wednesday morning, while Mo Salah and Sadio Mane played against each other for 120 minutes in an extremely tight game that went to penalties on Tuesday. ""There's also the issue at right-back and he has a decision to make as to who will fill in for the injured Trent Alexander-Arnold. ""So, Klopp will have to juggle his resources once again and while most people will have this as a home banker for Liverpool, who are on this incredible run at the moment and looking for a 10th straight league win, I think it will be a harder game for them than many people think.

Premier League table Live football on Sky Sports Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments ""It has to be a full-strength team for Liverpool, despite their busy schedule coming up. It's a simple formula for the Reds. They have to win every single game now, and that has been the same since January when they were 14 points behind. ""Can they keep it up? I think Liverpool can win the next nine games, absolutely. There is obviously the Man City game at the Etihad, which I'm sure, right now, Liverpool would take a point. Many people say they have to win that game, but I don't believe they do. ""A draw at City and eight wins, starting against Watford on Saturday, I think that would be enough to win the title."" Sky Sports' Joe Shread: ""I can't imagine it'd be a huge issue for a team as good and as big as Manchester City if Ruben Dias and John Stones were missing for the trip to Turf Moor. ""They have depth in their squad in Aymeric Laporte and Nathan Ake. Fernandinho has also done well as a centre back before. ""If you were talking about this being the situation ahead of that Liverpool game in just over a week's time then maybe you'd be a bit concerned, but with all due respect to Burnley, City should be able to cope this weekend even with a bit of a make-shift pairing at the back. ""Burnley have got a terrible record against City. They have lost their last nine in all competitions against City. Burnley haven't beaten Pep Guardiola's side since 2015. They haven't won in 14 games with 13 of those coming as defeats. The aggregate score in the last nine games between the two sides is 32-1 in favour of City. ""So, as much as Guardiola won't just be chalking this one up as a win, it's going to be a big shock if Burnley get anything out of this game, regardless of who plays at centre-back for City."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Joe Shread: ""I'm not so sure it will have much effect on the players. ""We've got to remember that it wasn't so long ago that all these Premier League games were being played in front of empty stadiums because of the pandemic. ""The players are very used to playing with no fans at all in the ground let alone 50 per cent full or 75 per cent full, whatever it is going to be at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. ""I think Chelsea, the team, deserve plenty of credit for what they have done since Roman Abramovich announced he was selling the club. They have won six in a row in all competitions. ""Thomas Tuchel seems to have done a very good job of keeping the team focused on matters on the field, especially when they are in a strange situation in the Premier League. They look too far ahead of the chasing pack to slip out of the top four, but they are too far behind Liverpool and Man City to challenge for the title. ""It's just a case of keeping the wins ticking over to make sure you sow up third and then you can really go for it in the Champions League and the FA Cup, and that, to be fair, is exactly what they have been doing since all the chaos off the field started.

""I think this is going to be an intriguing game. Leeds have the momentum of those two incredible late wins against Norwich and then that bonkers game against Wolves. ""You just wonder whether those two games have given Leeds the momentum they need to stay out of the relegation battle. They have moved seven points clear now of the drop zone and that is quite a cushion from the likes of Burnley. ""Another win here against Southampton and I think that is almost enough for Leeds. So, that is a huge incentive for Jesse Marsch's side when Saints visit Elland Road. ""Although die-hard Leeds fans would be ever loathe to admit this because of the work Marcelo Bielsa did for Leeds, the change in manager might have come just at the right time for Leeds because it's clear to see the impact Marsch has made already.

""At this stage of the season you just can't afford to slip up. There is no margin for error, especially at home against a mid-table side, which Leicester are this season. However, the Foxes do have a decent recent record against United, winning their last three games in all competitions against them. ""So, it is absolutely must-win for United.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: ""There's been a huge creative void at Everton this season. They have really struggled to score. ""It's been painful at times, but there have been reasons for it. ""Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who was the club's top scorer last season, has barely featured all season and he only has three league goals to his name in this campaign. Richarlison has also had injury struggles and although he scored three times in two matches for Brazil last week, he hasn't really had the same impact for Everton. ""Richarlison is the one for me, however. Everton need to get him the ball more. ""There are no real surprises to see his name in the papers again, linking him with a number of big-name teams again this summer, and it wouldn't surprise me to see him leave the club in the next transfer window. ""But before that Everton need him and he is the player that can provide the spark Frank Lampard's side have been missing. He has been one of their better players in recent weeks and will be crucial if Everton are to beat the drop. ""Everton's bigger issue is in midfield. How are they going to get the ball to Richarlison? How are they going to create chances? Abdoulaye Doucoure and Allan are their mainstays in the middle, but it is out wide where I have my concerns. ""I think it is going to be a very hard game for Everton, especially against David Moyes' West Ham, who are still in the hunt for Europe."" Sky Sports'Joe Shread: ""The job Eddie Howe has done at Newcastle is very impressive. You do caveat that with the amount of money he was able to spend in January. ""I know Kieran Trippier has been out injured for a lot of the time, but he did have an immediate impact when he first came in. Dan Burn looks good, and he has helped shore up that defence. ""So, he was able to spend money that other managers at the bottom end of the table weren't, including former Newcastle boss Steve Bruce. ""However, he has taken a lot of players that either were not in Bruce's plans or who were not playing well under Bruce, and he has turned them into key players. For example, Fabian Schar looks good at the back. Joelinton and Ryan Fraser looked to be bit-part players under Bruce but they are performing well now. ""So, Howe has done a really impressive job on the field and that defensive record is really impressive. They have only conceded eight goals in their last 11 games. They have lost very few games since Christmas and he has achieved the number one target, which was staying up. ""It will now be interesting to see how they do against Spurs where they will come up against Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son, who have looked terrific recently. It will be interesting to see whether this new-look Newcastle defence can deal with the threat of Kane and Son."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: ""The results that Man Utd and Spurs get against Leicester and Newcastle respectively will determine how much pressure will be cranked up on Arsenal when they travel to Crystal Palace on Monday Night Football. ""On paper, you'd probably expect two wins for United and Spurs as they both look to keep the pressure on in the race for the top-four, and in which case, there would be huge pressure on Arsenal because United and Spurs would be right on their coat tails. ""However, it would be no more pressure than they faced just before the international break when they went to Aston Villa and ground out a win just after losing to Liverpool. ""A lot of people were questioning how Arsenal would respond and that was a tricky looking assignment at Villa Park against an in-form Aston Villa team, and I think the game at Palace will be an equally tough test of their top-four credentials. ""It's a London derby, Selhurst Park under the lights and there will be a cracking atmosphere. I can see this being a huge test for the Gunners."" Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: ""It's a big weekend for Arsenal and Mikel Arteta. The pressure could really be on by the time they get to face Palace on Monday. This is going to be a tough game for Arsenal. There is obviously plenty to gain for Arsenal, but there is also plenty to lose, especially if the pressure is cracked up by wins for Spurs and United. You do just wonder that if this young Arsenal side start to drop a few points, could the wheels come off."" Sky Sports' Joe Shread: ""It's a huge few days for Everton, and in particular, Frank Lampard. Lampard is going back to West Ham, and he is not well liked there after he left the club to join rivals Chelsea. This could be a tasty affair. Lampard has only managed once at the London Stadium and that was as Chelsea boss when his side lost 3-2, but that was in front of an empty stadium. ""Obviously, the bigger picture for Everton is that they need as many points as they can get in this relegation battle, and this game could be a big opportunity for them. I know they are away from home against a very good West Ham side, but this is a weekend where Watford play Liverpool and Burnley play Man City. So, you'd expect those two sides to struggle and that could leave the door open for Everton, who could go six points clear of the drop zone with a win."" Sky Sports' Ron Walker: ""I'm going for Manchester United. The ball is not in their court in terms of getting into the top-four, so they need to be faultless with Leicester, Everton and Norwich in their next three games. That then takes them into a double header with Arsenal and Liverpool, but they could be out of the race altogether if they slip up against team they really should be beating. It's not the defeats that are going to cause them problems, it is the draws. They draw far too many games and any more and it will be curtains for their Champions League hopes."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: ""I've gone for something a bit unoriginal, but there have been mutterings that league leaders and champions Manchester City are about to be caught by Liverpool. I think plenty of people are playing City down. ""There are also mutterings that they might slip up at Burnely. It's a hard game and they have defensive worries, but I think they are going to slap down those concerns with a resounding 5-0 win just to quieten down those people who are questioning their title credentials."" Sky Sports' Joe Shread: ""I was looking for an upset and I am going for Crystal Palace and Gunners legend Patrick Vieira derailing Arsenal's top-four bid. Palace's FA Cup win over Everton was really impressive. I was really impressed with Palace, and they are now unbeaten in over a month, holding Man City to a 0-0 draw on MNF earlier this month. Arsenal have been good against the sides they should beat, and this is a game they should really win, but this one does look a tough proposition, and Vieira will be looking to impress against the club that helped to make him in English football."" Sky Sports' Ron Walker: ""My prediction is Newcastle to get something at Tottenham. The job Eddie Howe has done since going in at Newcastle has been fantastic. He's shored them up which a lot of people thought he couldn't do and also, you just don't know which Spurs will turn up.""

Since the Aaron Ramsdale, Ben White and Gabriel axis was formed four games into the season, Arsenal have scored 14 first-half goals in their last 11 away Premier League matches. Only Liverpool have scored more - and that's despite the Gunners playing two games less than the majority of their rivals. Mikel Arteta instructs his team to play aggressively from the off and that is seen by 11 of their 14 first-half goals away from home coming before the 30th minute. That is the most scored in that period when assessing away games, along with Liverpool. Arsenal have won their last five Premier League away games, scoring 14 goals and have led at the break in their last six - the only blip being the second-half collapse at Everton. Palace are a tough nut to crack at home, but do have a tendency of starting very slowly in matches. They have failed to score in the first half of 10 of their 15 home matches, including against Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham and Chelsea. All of this adds up to Arsenal being in front at the break at 13/8 with Sky Bet looking like a solid play.

After only previously signing Donny van de Beek during the summer transfer window, United completed four signings in the 24 hours that followed their 6-1 mauling at home to Tottenham even though Jadon Sancho, who United have chased all summer, remained at Dortmund and an enquiry to Watford for winger Ismaila Sarr didn't progress. Instead United recruited left-back Alex Telles for a fee of £15.4m, brought in 18-year-old Pellistri and signed Atlanta winger Amad Diallo, in a deal that could be worth up to £37.2m. The 18-year-old, who has only played 24 minutes in Serie A, will join the club in January. Cavani, 33, has signed a one-year contract with the option of a further 12 months and is expected to wear the club's iconic number seven shirt. ""Clearly Edinson Cavani has the work-ethic, the hunger to be a success at Manchester United,"" reported Sky Sports News' James Cooper. ""He's been impressed by the project he's been offered by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and in return Solskjaer has been impressed by Cavani. ""Solskjaer has said he will score goals.

The offer was for an initial £73m, rising to up to £91.3m, which fell short of Dortmund's £108m valuation. Sancho has not flown with the rest of the Dortmund squad for the German Super Cup in Munich against Bayern due to a ""respiratory infection"". He has tested negative for Covid-19. A bid was expected from the Premier League club this week, but all of the noises coming from Dortmund would suggest Sancho is staying in Germany. Earlier on Tuesday, Dortmund captain Marco Reus told Sky in Germany Sancho is staying for one more year. United have not given up on trying to sign the 20-year-old, despite missing the August 10 deadline the Bundesliga club had set for the deal to be completed. Despite the Dortmund hierarchy stating on several occasions - both before and after the deadline - that if it was not met Sancho would remain with the club, rumblings have continued over United submitting a bid before the transfer window closes on October 5. 'Man Utd can't do dark arts of transfers' Transfer Centre live! Man Utd transfer rumours Get Sky Sports United made a breakthrough in negotiations with Sancho's representatives earlier this month, with wages and agents fees no longer thought to be an issue for the Premier League club. However, on September 23, Dharmesh Sheth told The Transfer Show Borussia Dortmund had been left ""bemused"" by United's attempts to sign the England forward. United's only signing of the window so far has been central midfielder Donny van de Beek from Ajax, but manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has suggested the club are still hoping to do more business. If United do manage to agree a deal for Sancho with Dortmund, it could have an impact on England's preparations for October's international fixtures. With the Premier League's transfer window closing on Monday, United's pursuit of the winger could extend into Deadline Day - the same day in which England's squad are expected to arrive for duty. If Sancho is required to leave England's secure eco-bubble to undergo a medical, he would not be allowed to return, according to UEFA's coronavirus protocols. Gareth Southgate and his staff will want to limit disruption to their preparations, given how little time they have had to work with their players in recent months. An alternative to Sancho having to leave the camp could be to allow a small group of medical staff from United into the England bubble to conduct the tests. This would be within UEFA's rules as staff from Premier League clubs are regularly tested for coronavirus.

98,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/12085132/donny-van-de-beek-how-judo-helped-make-manchester-united-midfielder,Donny van de Beek: How judo helped make Manchester United midfielder,"Judo and badminton might not be the first two sports that one thinks of when working out how to build a footballer but perhaps that shows a lack of imagination. There were those at Ajax who saw it differently. Manchester United's Donny van de Beek is among a generation of talent who have benefited from the innovative ideas of Dutch coach Rene Wormhoudt. It was Wormhoudt who developed the Athletic Skills Model adopted by Ajax in the first part of the last decade. The principle was that youngsters needed to compete in other disciplines to become the best athletes that they could be. Racket sports were incorporated into the programme and, yes, even a dojo built so that these budding starts could go toe to toe. As Wormhoudt explains, it was centred on one simple idea. ""Only focusing on football might not be the best way to become a football player."" Now working as a strength and conditioning coach for the Netherlands national team, Wormhoudt still has the opportunity to work with some of the players who came through the Ajax academy after his ideas were embraced. Van de Beek, now 23, was among them. ""I spoke with Donny about this when I knew we were going to talk,"" Wormhoudt tells Sky Sports via a video call from his Netherlands home. ""He would never have been involved with judo or badminton if we hadn't implemented it in the educational programme at that time."" But how has it helped him? Keane: Ole needs top four United struggle with dark arts Latest transfer rumours Get Sky Sports ""The badminton for a football player is very good for the agility, the footwork, the quickness, but it is also very useful for the hand-eye coordination, spatial awareness and rotations. If you cannot rotate on both sides at the top level you notice it and you are gone, more or less. We trained a lot with him on his left and right hand, his left and right foot."" So far, so sensible. But judo? ""I grew up with judo and martial arts,"" Wormhoudt explains. ""What I realised is that if you could fall well, if you could have a better balance as well as the skills, you could become a better football player. ""Judo makes you very aware of the fall and when you are not afraid of the floor you make different decisions in your balance strategy. Zlatan Ibrahimovic did martial arts and he was not afraid to fall. Some guys who played outside and did volleyball or were goalkeepers, they learned not to be afraid, but most players do not know how to fall properly. ""What I learned from doing judo is that even if someone is stronger than me, I can decide which way we go. I can use your strength to my advantage. In that way, if I am totally comfortable in my balance I can use it to my advantage when you push me. ""Another benefit is core strength. This is important to performance and injury prevention. Judo also has a completely different culture to football. It all brings you something that you can use on the field. You can excel more because you are exposed to different ideas."" Wormhoudt has become accustomed to resistance - not least from fellow coaches. While he once had the support of Louis van Gaal and other influential figures at Ajax, it is a club familiar with schisms, where the battlefield of ideas can be a bloody one. They have since moved away from a programme that saw as much as half the time spent on other sports. Parents too have questioned his methods. ""A lot of parents think that the only way to make a better player is to spend many hours on the pitch, but that is just a quantity idea. The idea that if I spend more hours on the pitch than you I am going to be better isn't right. What about quality? What am I actually doing? You still need to play football but it just a part of it. That is difficult for people to accept."" Wormhoudt understands elite sport and he is well aware that putting in the time on football details remains vital. But he is armed with the research that suggests there is a better way. ""My colleague Professor Savelsbergh showed me a study in the United Kingdom that revealed children who played three or more sports at the ages of 11 had significantly more chance of representing a national team in one of those sports. But what do we do when an 11-year-old kid is good at football? We tell them to stop playing tennis."" He tells stories of Johan Cruyff and his fascination with baseball, Marco van Basten and his rare talent with a racket in his hand. ""I worked a lot with him and he is the example of what I am telling you about. At the moment, he does a lot of squash, but back in the day, he was doing a lot of other sports. He even did diving, the backwards flip and so on. It helped him. ""Ruud van Nistelrooy told me that he did taekwondo and other sports and this helped him as a striker in football."" Again, his ideas are supported by evidence. ""There is a great piece of research from Belgium that underpinned my ideas at Ajax. They found that when you trained in one sport for two hours you had a certain motoric IQ. When you trained six hours your IQ went up. Logical. But when you trained for two hours in three different sports your IQ really went up. In fact, spending two hours doing three different sports was the equivalent of six hours doing one sport. So in less time you learn quicker. ""If you want to make a better football player, you want to make a better person and that all starts with the brain. That is a much bigger field. If you are skilful that is not going to be enough at the top level. There are so many other things that you need. ""The basic movement skills like climbing and moving to music are also very important for your motor skills, adaptation, decision-making and your pattern recognition and your anticipation. ""This variety is so important. You need different experiences because it helps your adaptive ability. You can make yourself very special if you can adapt better than the other guy. ""But if you do not train your adaptive abilities, you will have worse pattern recognition, anticipation, decision-making and so on. So we need to develop the brain. You need a healthy body too but if you don't see what is happening, it is too late and it looks horrible. ""It is just a more holistic approach."" Ajax has since moved away from that approach. ""Other people came in,"" says Wormhoudt. ""Go away with the dojo where they did the judo. Go away with the gymnastic hall. They could not get rid of the athletic skills track so it is still used for rehabilitation but it is not in the way that I had wanted or as intensely as it was. ""It is a case study now. The fact that we are still number one having spent half the time doing other sports shows the truth of that study in Belgium. You can be effective with less hours and use the rest of the time to develop your 'football' athletic ability."" Catch the action for only £25 a month with this limited time offer. Watch the Premier League, Formula 1, PGA Tour and much more. Cancel any time. Indeed, it is fascinating to think that there is now a generation of talent emerging at Ajax, including members of the squad that so wowed Europe in reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League in 2019, who were developed in line with Wormhoudt's ideas. ""I got a lot of satisfaction from that. I am very cautious about saying it is my influence. I cannot say that. It would be impossible to claim that. I will just wait for people to wake up."" In the meantime, Wormhoudt is expanding his vision far beyond elite sport. He has created the Athletic Skills Model and the Skills Garden, a solution for public spaces. In effect, these are super playgrounds designed to optimise the learning experience while making children more healthy. ""Kids used to play outside,"" he explains. ""They would climb and they would play fight. That is gone now. So we need to fill in that development. That was my idea at Ajax. ""But the advantages of a diversified background, a background that makes it possible for you to become a footballer, also has a lot of health advantages. They can apply to anyone. Less injury. A healthier lifestyle. Less drop outs, more creativity and a longer athletic life. It is a much bigger idea."" Naturally, he has incorporated his beliefs about the need for a variety of skills to develop the all-round athlete into the Skills Garden. ""I have implemented it in the design,"" he adds. ""I put a lot of asymmetric parts because it develops our creativity. When we were kids, we played around lampposts and cars. But when the adults came in, it all became symmetric so we lost that creativity and because we don't play outside it has a double effect. ""I am still developing and innovating. It is about building a better world."" As for Van de Beek, he has some adapting to do for himself as he makes the adjustment to a new life in the Premier League. Fortunately, he has had some help in that respect. ""He needs to adapt quickly to a new situation and a new intensity of playing. Not only the matches but also in the training. I hear players talk about the Premier League and say that it is much more intense than the Dutch league so it will be interesting. How will he adapt? I hope that I taught him a lot about adaptation."" There is even time for one more anecdote to illustrate the point. ""It is funny,"" adds Wormhoudt. ""I spoke to Jari Litmanen about ice-hockey training. I asked him what he learned from that. He said that he learned how to make decisions quickly, but the other thing he learned was not to get into the duels. That is a kind of adaptation. ""I hope that Donny can take that with him because he is less the man for the duels. He needs to be thinking faster and acting faster than the rest. If that is going to happen quickly then Manchester United are going to have a lot of fun with him."" You read correctly. Do not miss your chance to scoop £1m for free in this week's Super 6 round.

After only previously signing Donny van de Beek during the summer transfer window, United completed four signings in the 24 hours that followed their 6-1 mauling at home to Tottenham even though Jadon Sancho, who United have chased all summer, remained at Dortmund and an enquiry to Watford for winger Ismaila Sarr didn't progress. Instead United recruited left-back Alex Telles for a fee of £15.4m, brought in 18-year-old Pellistri and signed Atlanta winger Amad Diallo, in a deal that could be worth up to £37.2m.

""He's been impressed by the project he's been offered by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and in return Solskjaer has been impressed by Cavani. ""Solskjaer has said he will score goals.

United bought Donny van de Beek from Ajax in a deal worth up to £39m, but the midfielder remains their only summer arrival despite efforts to sign £108m-rated Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho and Porto left-back Alex Telles. Throughout the summer, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have also been linked with moves for Gareth Bale and Sergio Reguilon - who have both joined Tottenham - and new Liverpool midfielder Thiago Alcantara. United manager Solskjaer says the club are ""working hard"" in the transfer market and could do more business before October 5, but the lack of activity so far in this window has led to widespread fan discontent. Mitten - the editor of fanzine United We Stand - says supporters do not believe in the club's strategy and referred to a recent conversation he had with a former United player. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""United fans do not have a lot of faith in the club's recruitment policy. They feel that there has been mixed messages,"" Mitten told Sky Sports News. ""Back in March/April, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said the club could perhaps take advantage of the coronavirus situation because they might be in a stronger financial position, but at one point United were the only Premier League team not to sign a single player in this transfer window. Last-gasp drama as Man Utd snatch Brighton win Man Utd transfer rumours Transfer Centre LIVE! Premier League ins and outs ""One former player said to me this week - a legendary United player - that the club have lost the ability to do the dark arts of transfers and he gave an example. ""If Sir Alex Ferguson wanted a player, the player would know that Ferguson wanted him, would know where he was going to play and he'd be sold the dream. Then he'd go to his agent and say 'look, I want to leave.' ""It's very difficult for a club then to negotiate when they know that player wants to leave to go to Manchester United. ""It was this player's opinion that those dark arts have been lost and you can see it, because United have been linked to all of these players and they don't often have any control with agents linking their players to the club. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's very frustrating for fans because they're getting completely mixed messages and they've seen just one player come in so far. ""I don't think anyone has the same pulling power as Sir Alex Ferguson but to be fair to Ole, he's been putting calls in and I know he's spoken to several managers about players who he likes. ""He's doing detailed background checks and I don't think the blame lies with him. It's the club's recruitment system which has not worked since Sir Alex Ferguson moved on.""

United finished third in the Premier League last season - significant progress on the previous campaign - but trailed champions Liverpool by 33 points and second-placed Manchester City by 15. Their last-gasp 3-2 win at Brighton on Saturday secured their first three points of 2020/21 but it was a disappointing display. It followed last week's defeat to Crystal Palace, and Mitten believes it highlights the need for more competition in the squad. ""United have played two league games and played pretty poorly in both of them. Deserved to lose against Palace and were very lucky to win against Brighton. The issue here is the manager doesn't feel he has competition in all positions,"" Mitten said. ""Victor Lindelof probably wouldn't have started yesterday if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer felt he had more competition. Lindelof has played well in the past and will probably play well in the future - he played very well against Manchester City for example - but there's a lack of competition. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""United felt they needed more competition in midfield, that's why Donny van de Beek has come in. They feel they need more competition up front, because what happens if one of those brilliant top three players gets injured? That's why Jadon Sancho has been the main target. ""They want more competition at left-back as well. Judging by the way the defence played at Brighton, they need more competition right across the back. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""United fans aren't happy. It's been a poor transfer window in their eyes. Only one player has come in, United are struggling to get rid of players. Players who earn too much money and who have been given contracts. Do these players want to play football, or do they just want to pick up the money and sit on the bench?

Signing a new central midfielder is one of the club's priorities in the upcoming window, and they are very interested in the 25-year-old. However, Wolves value the Portugal international at between £50m and £60m - and the Gunners face stiff competition from other clubs. Chief among those is Barcelona, who have considerable interest in him too, despite doubts over their financial clout in the next market. Manchester United and Tottenham have also been interested in Neves this season, although Spurs signed midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur in January and United's transfer plans are yet to be finalised considering they have not yet appointed a new permanent manager. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It means Arsenal are encouraged to pursue a deal for Neves after they were unable to sign a new central midfielder in January, having then made a considerable effort to strike a loan deal with Juventus for Arthur Melo. They have also held an interest in Aston Villa's Douglas Luiz. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports The Gunners want a new long-term partner for Thomas Partey and Martin Odegaard in midfield, with Granit Xhaka's future at the Emirates unclear beyond the summer given there is still interest from Jose Mourinho at Roma. Arsenal also intend to sign a new number nine this summer after missing out on Dusan Vlahovic to Juventus in January, while they have also been scouting more attacking right wing-backs than their current options. Wolves head coach Bruno Lage suggested last week a deal for the Portugal international would cost £100m - the same amount Man City spent to break the British transfer record to buy Jack Grealish last summer. ""I don't know if it's Man Utd or other teams, what I know is we have a special player here with us"", said Lage, addressing the speculation surrounding one of his most key players. ""What he is doing this season is very good. I think also the way we play, he can show a better Ruben, and also the way he plays puts our team on a different level. ""When you have that player, the best thing to do is improve his salary and years of contract. ""But who knows, when you have a top player like him in that specific position, that can defend and attack, and is a top professional and a great man, the big teams are there with £100m to buy these kinds of players.""

Alli has joined the Toffees on a two-and-a-half-year deal as he looks to reignite his stalling career at Goodison Park. The potential £40m transfer fee will be structured based on performance-related add-ons. New Everton manager Frank Lampard, who was only officially appointed boss on Monday afternoon, was a key factor in convincing the 25-year-old to join the club. It comes after Lampard also persuaded midfielder Donny van de Beek to join on loan from Manchester United for the rest of the season. Alli could potentially make his Everton debut in the Premier League fixture at Newcastle United next Tuesday. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player In an exclusive interview with Sky Sports News after his move to Everton was confirmed late on Deadline Day, Alli spoke of Lampard's influence in convincing him to move to Merseyside, where he hopes he can finally rekindle his joy for football after a difficult end to his time at Spurs. Why Lampard influence can inspire Alli at Everton Transfer Centre LIVE! Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports ""I'm very excited, a bit tired from the long day but we got there in the end. I'm delighted,"" Alli said. ""I've had a few good conversations with him [Lampard] already, he's a player I admired through his whole career watching him. I'm pleased to work with him, it's very exciting, I'm sure we can do great things together. ""I just want to be happy playing football. Working with Lampard, and the great players Everton have got, is a great opportunity for me to do that. I'm excited to go there, show the fans what I can do, and help the club as much as I can."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Alli leaves Tottenham after seven years at the club after he joined from MK Dons in February 2015 for just £5m. He made 269 appearances in all competitions for Spurs and scored 67 goals, including 51 in the Premier League. The England midfielder won back-to-back PFA Young Player of the Year awards for the 2015/16 and 2016/17 seasons and also helped Spurs to reach their first Champions League final in 2019. But Alli has failed to continue that success in recent seasons with his career stagnating in north London. He has struggled to make an impact this campaign under new Spurs head coach Antonio Conte, having made just six appearances in all competitions since the Italian arrived in November. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol on The Transfer Show: ""We're told Frank Lampard was key in this deal getting done. He spoke to the player, and Alli feels he can get the best out of him. ""Since Mauricio Pochettino left Spurs he's had a difficult relationship with the managers there, Mourinho and Conte, and needs a fresh start. ""He's been at Spurs for a long time now, I know people think he's lost his way now but he's someone who was PFA Young Player of the Year twice. If anyone can get the best out of him, you'd think it would be someone like Frank Lampard."" Sky Sports' Ben Grounds: More than two years ago in October 2019, Gary Neville gave this assessment of Dele Alli after an anonymous display in a 2-1 away defeat against Liverpool. ""He had a desire to get in the box. He was always nasty, playing on the edge, getting sent off once or twice, but today he was non-existent. He's been like that for a year or two."" More than two years have passed since then, and we are still yet to see Alli return to the sort of form that took him to back-to-back PFA young player of the year awards. Still only 25, Alli has now worked under several managers at Spurs since breaking into the first team under Mauricio Pochettino and yet he has failed to fully convince Jose Mourinho, Nuno Espirito Santo and Antonio Conte he is worth giving a central role. It is hard to pinpoint his fall from grace, but Frank Lampard could be the ideal manager to turn a lost talent back into star quality. The new Everton boss would urge him to get back to basics, but feeling loved is what Alli needs. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  His time at Tottenham truly ought to have come to an end some time ago, but a fresh start at Everton, a side he has often performed well against, provides him with an opportunity to fulfil his undoubted talent. It is an arrangement that suits all parties, with Tottenham now able to build a squad in Conte's image, while Alli's ability to cover distance and play with intensity is something Everton have needed to inject into their game this season. A loan deal might have not led anywhere, pushing the need for a change along, but with Everton already having used up their two domestic loan slots, a permanent deal brings closure for Alli at Spurs. Lampard and Everton will hope he can now rediscover his old swagger on Merseyside. Sky Sports' Adam Bate: As Dele Alli's Tottenham career reaches a conclusion that few could have anticipated when he won back-to-back PFA young player of the year awards, much of the focus will be on the mental side of the game. The need to refocus will be at the forefront of the discussion. The words of Jose Mourinho in conversation with Alli in a much-publicised documentary appear prescient. ""I think you will regret it if you do not reach what you can reach."" But it is worth noting that there are tactical questions to address here as well as mental ones. The hope is that Frank Lampard and Everton appreciate what is required to bring out the best in Alli. His impact came as a support striker making late runs into the penalty box. He was combative and cute so could play deeper but that was not his main strength. Over time, Alli has been deployed further and further away from the opposition goal, even used in a midfield two, where the responsibilities in the build-up play put greater emphasis on other aspects of his game. It has become hard to remember what made him so good. Whether he is able to recapture that remains to be seen. At 25, there is still time. The attitude will need to be right, the desire to prove people wrong essential. But his only chance of doing that will be if Lampard has a clear vision of how to utilise him.

Eriksen left Inter Milan in December by mutual consent after being suspended by the Italian medical authority from playing in Serie A due to a rule prohibiting the use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) device he has had fitted. The 29-year-old had the ICD fitted after he suffered a cardiac arrest during Denmark's Euro 2020 match against Finland in Copenhagen. He has completed all the necessary medical checks and is fit to return to football. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player In a video posted by Brentford's official Twitter account, Eriksen said: ""I'm happy to announce that I've signed for Brentford football club. I can't wait to get started and hopefully I'll see you all very soon."" Before signing for Brentford, Eriksen had been training in southern Switzerland and stepped up his preparations for a return last week by training with his former side Ajax. The deal was completed with Eriksen still in the Netherlands. Eriksen moves to Brentford with a strong Danish connection at the club. Boss Thomas Frank, who coached Eriksen as Denmark U17 boss 13 years ago, and international team-mates Christian Norgaard and Mathias Jensen are among many known to the midfielder. Frank said: ""I am looking forward to working with Christian again. It has been a while since I last coached him, and a lot has happened since then. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports ""Christian was 16 at the time and has become one of the best midfield players to appear in the Premier League. He has also won trophies all over Europe and become the star of the Danish national team. ""We have taken an unbelievable opportunity to bring a world-class player to Brentford. He hasn't trained with a team for seven months but has done a lot of work on his own. ""He is fit but we will need to get him match fit and I am looking forward to seeing him work with the players and staff to get back towards his highest level. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""At his best, Christian has the ability to dictate games of football. He can find the right passes and is a goal threat. He also has very, very good set-piece delivery, both from corners and direct free kicks. ""He is a player you can find with the ball, and he will come up with a solution to the problem in front of him. Christian will also bring experience of top-level football to the club. I expect him to have an impact in the dressing room and at the training ground."" Eriksen has said his heart is ""not an obstacle"" to get back playing - and in England athletes are given the autonomy to decide themselves whether or not to continue on the balance of risk. It is not illegal in the UK for Eriksen to play with an ICD and he will become the first ever to play with one in the Premier League. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Discussing the process of signing him, Brentford director of football Phil Giles said: ""We first discussed the possibility of Christian joining Brentford when we heard that he would be leaving Inter. It is fantastic that he is now with us. ""Naturally the process of signing Christian was more elongated than most transfers. I understand that many people will have questions about the process. ""In order to respect Christian's medical confidentiality, we won't be going into any details. Brentford fans can rest assured that we have undertaken significant due diligence to ensure that Christian is in the best possible shape to return to competitive football. ""Now Christian has made the decision to sign for Brentford, all parties want to focus fully on football. ""We are sure that Christian will make a big impact at Brentford and on the Premier League between now and the end of the season."" Eriksen recently received his Covid-19 vaccination and, to comply with rules regarding entry to the UK, he will travel to west London in the coming days and will not train this week. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Eriksen revealed earlier this month he ""died for five minutes"" before being revived by medics, who gave life-saving treatment on the pitch in Copenhagen. He also told Danish broadcaster DR he wants to play at this year's World Cup. Eriksen said: ""My goal is to play in the World Cup in Qatar. I want to play. That's been my mindset all along. It's a goal, a dream. ""Whether I'll be picked is another thing, but it's my dream to come back. ""Physically, I'm back in top shape. I want to prove I've moved on and that I can play on the national team again. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It's up to the manager to assess my level but my heart is not an obstacle."" Last month, Eriksen's agent Martin Schoots told Sky Sports News the midfielder was ""optimistic"" about resuming his football career and had been working hard to return to playing. Sky Sports' Adam Smith: Eriksen was the undisputed king of assists during his six-and-a-half-year spell with Tottenham - ranking top for creating goals and carving chances in the Premier League during that time. In addition, the Dane led for producing the spectacular with a league-topping 23 goals struck from outside the box, of which eight of those came from direct free-kicks. The graphic below reveals the illustrious elite in his company, including the likes of Mesut Ozil, David Silva, Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne - of which only the latter would notably exceed Eriksen for creative returns per 90. In terms of positioning, Eriksen frequently topped the running metrics during his time at Tottenham and primarily operated centrally, midway inside the opposition half - creating chances from every angle. His creative output declined at Inter Milan, failing to secure a regular starting berth before his horrific collapse at Euro 2020 last year - but Eriksen is an undisputed world-class talent and a stellar acquisition for Thomas Frank's side.

Winger Kulusevski joins on an 18-month loan deal that costs Spurs £8.3m - £2.5m this season and £5.8m next season - while there is an obligation to buy the Sweden international for £29.2m if certain sporting criteria are met. Meanwhile, midfielder Bentancur joins the north London club permanently after signing a four-and-a-half-year deal subject to international clearance and a work permit. The deal for the Uruguay international could cost up to £21.5m with Tottenham paying Juve £15.8m up front, with £5.7m due in potential add-ons. The move for Kulusevski comes after Spurs were beaten to the signing of Porto's Luis Diaz by Liverpool. Spurs wanted to sign the Colombia international this month, but he preferred a move to Jurgen Klopp's side and completed his switch to Anfield on Sunday.

January transfer window: Done deals Papers - latest headlines Get Sky Sports Kulusevski has made 27 appearances for Juventus in all competitions this season, but only seven of those were starts. The 21-year-old, who has three-and-a-half years remaining on his contract, has scored twice during the current campaign. Kulusevski's arrival has paved the way for Spurs winger Bryan Gil to join Valencia on loan until the end of the season. The Spaniard has made 20 appearances in all competitions this season but is yet to start a Premier League game and has not scored a goal. Spurs have also moved for Kulusevski's Juve team-mate Bentancur after they loaned out midfielders Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso on Deadline Day. Midfielder Dele Alli is also closing in on a permanent switch to Everton, while the club are also trying to offload Giovani Lo Celso. Bentancur has featured regularly for Juve this season, making 18 starts in all competitions and providing three assists. Aston Villa were also keen to sign the 24-year-old Uruguay international, but saw a £20.5m offer rejected by Juventus earlier this month, according to Sky in Italy. Fabio Paratici, Tottenham's managing director of football, oversaw the signings of both Kulusevski from Atalanta in January 2020 and Bentancur from Boca Juniors in 2017 during his time at Juventus. After completing the deals for Kulusevski and Bentancur, Sky Sports News has been told it is unlikely Spurs will sign any more players before the deadline.

""Conte and Fabio are the right couple to allow Kulusevski to reach his highest level. ""Rodrigo Bentancur is an important midfielder. I feel he can be important for Tottenham. In the last months at Juventus, he didn't play so well because he needed to change. ""Antonio can let him play in the right way.

The 25-year-old striker has signed a four-and-a-half-year deal at the Amex, but will remain on loan at Union - who currently lead the Belgian top flight - until the end of the season.

Dan Ashworth, the Seagulls' technical director, added: ""Deniz is an exciting player who will add variation to our attacking options for next season.""

The Netherlands international's wages will be paid in full by the Toffees, who do not have an option to make his move permanent. Crystal Palace and Valencia were also in talks to sign Van de Beek during the January transfer window, but he opted for a switch to Goodison Park. Van de Beek declared himself fit and available for next Tuesday's Premier League visit to Newcastle United, as he is cup-tied for Saturday's match against with Brentford. Van de Beek says the appointment of Frank Lampard was the driving force behind his move. ""I had a really positive meeting with the new coach,"" he said. ""We have the same ideas about football and he had a lot of influence on my decision. ""I played against him when I was at Ajax, and he was at Chelsea [as manager], so he knows me as a player. He thinks I have qualities that can help the team. I can learn a lot from him because he was a little bit in the same position - a midfield player who scored a lot of goals. Transfer Centre LIVE! Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports Get NOW TV ""He can help me a lot, so I think I'm in a good spot. I want to improve with Everton. There are always things that can be better and I work hard every day to do that."" He added: ""I want to show my qualities, my strengths, to the people in England - but especially the fans from Everton."" Palace began negotiations with United after Dennis Bergkamp - the father of Van de Beek's partner - triggered talks. Valencia were also in discussions with United over the 24-year-old, but there were doubts about whether the Spanish side could cover his salary. Van de Beek struggled to break into the first team at Old Trafford since a £39m move from Ajax in the summer of 2020. He was a largely peripheral figure under both current interim manager Ralf Rangnick and former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer despite a goalscoring debut for the club. It is thought Van de Beek felt let down by Solskjaer after he had given him assurances over playing time. But Van de Beek also struggled to make an impact under Rangnick, having been restricted to just 380 minutes of action this season without starting a Premier League match. He has just two goals and two assists to his name in 50 United appearances. Van de Beek's future will be re-assessed after the season ends, when United will have a new manager in place. He had been the talisman of Ajax's exciting young team under Erik ten Hag, which reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2019, scoring six goals in the competition and 28 more in over 100 appearances in the Eredivisie. The midfielder has three-and-a-half years to run on his contract at Old Trafford, although United hold an option to extend the deal by a further year. Donny van de Beek's arrival at Old Trafford caused no shortage of excitement. Darren Fletcher described him as a ""bargain"" at £39m. Ole Gunnar Solskajer talked up his ""fantastic"" quality. A giddy Rio Ferdinand addressed him as ""Sir Donny"" on Twitter. The 24-year-old had attracted interest from a host of top European clubs while at Ajax, his outstanding performances during their run to the Champions League semi-finals in 2019 marking him out as one of the most exciting young midfielders around. But his move to Manchester United has been a story of frustration and stalled progress. Van de Beek made only four Premier League starts in his first season. This time around, the Netherlands midfielder is yet to make one. Van de Beek's biggest obstacle at Manchester United has been the presence of Bruno Fernandes. Van de Beek played his best football for Ajax in the No 10 position, scoring and creating goals at a formidable rate, but by the time he arrived at Old Trafford in September 2020, Fernandes was firmly established as United's most important player in the position. The Portugal international had made a transformative impact following his arrival from Sporting Lisbon eight months earlier, scoring eight goals and providing seven assists in his first 14 Premier League appearances to help United secure a third-placed finish. He has continued in the same vein ever since. Fernandes has scored more goals (25) and contributed more assists (17) in the Premier League than any other Manchester United player since the start of last season. He has also played the most minutes (4,879). Van de Beek, by contrast, has played just 582 minutes in the same time frame. A player who enjoyed major prominence at Ajax has had to settle for a peripheral role throughout his time at United. There have been occasional flashes of his quality - most recently with his well-taken goal against Watford in November - but his attacking output has not come close to matching Fernandes' on the rare occasions he has been thrown into the side. For many Manchester United supporters, there is frustration more effort has not been made to accommodate Van de Beek elsewhere in the team, but that always looked challenging. There was no obvious role for him in Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1 formation - he is too offensively-minded to play in the midfield two, and not quick or powerful enough to occupy one of the wide positions - and interim manager Ralf Rangnick has now reverted to the same system having unsuccessfully trialled a 4-2-2-2 set-up following his appointment. Solskjaer talked about Van de Beek and Fernandes complementing each other's qualities following the former's arrival at the club back in 2020 but 18 months on neither he nor Rangnick has found room for them both in the same team. Tellingly, they have only started six games together in all competitions since the start of last season. The clock is ticking.

Burn has signed a two-and-a-half-year deal at his hometown club Newcastle, where he was a season-ticket holder as a boy. Burn told the club's official website: ""I'm buzzing to be here. I never thought I'd be in this position so to be a Newcastle player and to be around St. James' Park, it's something I've dreamt of since I was a kid. ""I can't wait to step out in the shirt and to see what it feels like. From sitting in the East Stand as a kid to now, it's crazy. I'm excited to get started."" The Magpies saw two bids turned down before settling on a fee of £13m with Brighton. Burn, who was in the final 18 months of his Brighton contract, is understood to have undergone a medical over the weekend. He is Newcastle's fifth signing of the January transfer window, following the arrivals of Kieran Trippier, Chris Wood, Bruno Guimaraes and Matt Targett. Transfer Centre LIVE! January transfer window: Done deals Deadline Day: How to follow Paper Talk Newcastle boss Eddie Howe said: ""I'm delighted to bring Dan back to the North East. He knows exactly what it means to represent this club and he will be a big presence for us on and off the pitch. ""We have been very keen to add competition defensively and Dan fits the profile we have been looking for. He is naturally left-footed, which provides further balance to our backline, and he will be a great addition to the group."" The Magpies have wanted to sign a left-footed centre-back all window to partner Jamaal Lascelles. But they failed in their attempts to sign Sven Botman, Diego Carlos and Benoit Badiashile, making Burn a top target in the final days of the window. Burn, who joined Brighton from Wigan in 2018, can also play left-back. However, there was disappointment for Newcastle on Deadline Day with Manchester United blocking their bid to sign Jesse Lingard and Hugo Ekitike rejecting a move to St James' after Reims accepted a £25m bid. Brighton boss Graham Potter told the club's official website: ""We were not actively looking to sell Dan during this window, but the transfer represents a very good transfer for our club and the player. ""Newcastle are Dan's boyhood club, and this move allows him to potentially play out the rest of his career at his home club. ""Ever since I have been at the club, Dan has been brilliant for me. He is a superb professional, adaptable and a great character on and off the pitch. ""We will miss him here, but we understand his reasons for wanting to move and he goes with our thanks and very best wishes for the future."" Sky Sports News' Keith Downie: ""Newcastle have been left a little bit light up front. Yes, they have signed Chris Wood, but they are a little bit short in the attacking third of the pitch. ""But overall, they will be fairly pleased with the window in terms of the number of players they have brought in. They have made real inroads this window but they have been left a little short up without signing Hugo Ekitike or Jesse Lingard."" Newcastle have signed midfielder Bruno Guimaraes from Lyon for £40m. Guimaraes, 24, completed a medical in Brazil on Friday ahead of signing a contract until 2026. Newcastle agreed a package of £33.3m plus around £6.5m in add-ons with French club Lyon to make the midfielder their third signing this January, following the arrivals of Kieran Trippier and Chris Wood. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The Magpies are spreading the payments over the next four years. They will pay Lyon around £3.25m if they stay up this season, with another £3.25m due if they stay up again next season. There is no relegation release clause in the deal Newcastle have agreed with the player. Newcastle head of recruitment Steve Nickson had travelled to Brazil to seal the signing of Guimaraes. The midfielder will play for Brazil on Wednesday and will not be able to travel to the UK to meet his new team-mates and head coach Eddie Howe until Thursday at the earliest. Arsenal were among a number of clubs interested in signing Guimaraes, who has also been watched closely by Manchester United and PSG.

It was Rangers' long-time performance director Adam Owen who gave Zukowski his debut in professional football when he was in charge at Lechia Gdansk. The Pole had only just turned 16 at the time but had impressed everyone at the club with his potential. ""I had heard good things about him from the assistant coaches,"" Owen tells Sky Sports. ""I watched him play in the academy games a couple of times. He was only 16 but was playing for the U19s and physically he did alright, looked like he could handle it. ""I brought him on at the end of a game for his debut. I took him up to train with the first team, then took him away on pre-season in Turkey. He did the January training camp there. He played against Qarabag and stayed with the first team from then on."" Owen, who is now a faculty member at ISSPF, the football education platform, recognised the talent, but it is only in the past season, following a loan spell in Poland's second tier, and a gradual progression, that he has really emerged as an attacking right-back.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Jack Wilkinson: Ramsey was widely applauded for taking the leap to go and play overseas, and it's a decision that has almost certainly been vindicated. Despite not quite hitting the levels he did in his final season at Arsenal, Ramsey's first two campaigns at Juventus under Maurizio Sarri and then Andrea Pirlo were a success and saw the Welshman win Serie A, Coppa Italia and Italian Super Cup titles. Issues have cropped up this season under Massimiliano Allegri, however, mainly in the form of injuries, which have limited him to just three Serie A appearances this season. In fact, Ramsey has missed 17 games this season, as many as he did in his first two seasons combined at Juventus. Ramsey will undoubtedly look back at his time at Juventus, the success he's enjoyed, and the opportunity to experience a new footballing culture, fondly, but for a player aged 31, and with a decent chunk of his career remaining, he cannot be appearing as infrequently as he has. With Juventus reportedly keen to get Ramsey's hefty salary off the wage bill, moving on from the club could be one that suits both club and player. A clearer indication of the prowess Ramsey still possesses, and his possible suitability to Rangers, can be seen upon studying his performances for Wales since he moved to Juventus, rather than his final-season struggles in Turin. Remarkably, Ramsey has scored more goals for his country, 13, since moving to Juventus than he actually has for Juventus, and that's despite playing three times the number of Serie A games. In terms of his name and reputation alone, three-time FA Cup winner Ramsey would definitely sprinkle some stardust on Giovani van Bronckhorst's squad, who head into 2022 in position to retain the Scottish Premiership title.

Arsenal became willing to allow the 32-year-old to leave after stripping him of the captaincy in December following a disciplinary issue. The 32-year-old did not play for the club after December 6, and was left out of their squad for their warm-weather training camp in Dubai. Aubameyang, who scored 92 goals in 163 games for the Gunners, leaves the Emirates Stadium inside the final 18 months of a contract worth £350,000 a week. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The Premier League club are estimated to be making a saving of around £25m in wages with Aubameyang's departure. But his exit means Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta's will finish the season with just two recognised strikers in his squad, with both Eddie Nketiah and Alex Lacazette out of contract in the summer. The deal had looked off earlier on Deadline Day after talks broke down over the financial part of the deal. But it is understood that Aubameyang, who flew out to Barcelona on Monday morning, took a significant pay cut to facilitate the move. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol: ""This is a big risk by Mikel Arteta because what happens if Aubameyang goes to Barcelona and scores a lot of goals? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It just shows how much Arsenal are backing the judgement of their manager. Arteta is saying 'I know he is our best goalscorer, he is the club captain, he is the highest earner at the club for disciplinary reasons l don't want him at the club'. It's a big, big call. ""I know he is leaving Arsenal under a bit of a cloud but there are also a lot of good memories. His ratio of goals to games is right up there with the great players. ""Arsenal supporters will say 'we are weaker now than we were at the start of the window'. But in this instance, you have to back Mikel Arteta's judgement - that is what the Arsenal owners are doing."" Sky Sports' Adam Bate: ""The drop in performance levels has been so great that it is probably worth reminding people that Aubameyang was a world-class striker for much of his time at Arsenal. ""Indeed, from the day of his debut for the club in February 2018 until the day of his double against Everton in February 2020, no player scored more Premier League goals. He scored 49 times in that period, the same as Mohamed Salah and a dozen more than Harry Kane. ""There was a notable highlight after that when he scored twice in Arsenal's FA Cup final win over Chelsea in the summer of 2020. But almost as soon as his new contract was signed that September, there has been a sense of decline, of a player whose best days are behind him. ""Stripped of the captaincy, too often the leadership has had to come from elsewhere. It is the young players driving Arsenal on under Mikel Arteta, not their best-paid player. That is a situation the club knows well having been through similar with Mesut Ozil. It cannot last. ""At 32, there will be hope that Aubameyang could yet recapture his best form, inspired by new surroundings and the challenge of restoring Barcelona to their former glories. At Arsenal, any regret will be tempered by the feeling that it is time for the club to move on."" Paul Merson told Sky Sports: Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""If Alexandre Lacazette puts the open goal chance away against Burnley, it is job done and no one is moaning at all. ""Everyone would be talking about how good a result that would have been for Arsenal with a clean sheet too. It's 1-0 to the Arsenal and everything is great. But he misses an open goal and all of a sudden, they have only scored one goal in January, which came in their best performance by a mile. ""That's the problem Arsenal have. You are not going to win too much without a centre forward. ""I know people will say Manchester City do, but they still have to win the Champions League playing with a false nine.

115,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11678/12527185/bruno-guimaraes-newcastle-sign-brazil-international-midfielder-from-lyon,Bruno Guimaraes: Newcastle sign Brazil international midfielder from Lyon,"Newcastle have signed midfielder Bruno Guimaraes from Lyon for £40m. Guimaraes, 24, completed a medical in Brazil on Friday ahead of signing a contract until 2026. Newcastle agreed a package of £33.3m plus around £6.5m in add-ons with French club Lyon to make the midfielder their third signing this January, following the arrivals of Kieran Trippier and Chris Wood. The Magpies are spreading the payments over the next four years. They will pay Lyon around £3.25m if they stay up this season, with another £3.25m due if they stay up again next season. There is no relegation release clause in the deal Newcastle have agreed with the player. Newcastle head of recruitment Steve Nickson had travelled to Brazil to seal the signing of Guimaraes. The midfielder will play for Brazil on Wednesday and will not be able to travel to the UK to meet his new team-mates and head coach Eddie Howe until Thursday at the earliest. How box-to-box Bruno can boost Toon Newcastle fixtures Premier League table Get Sky Sports Arsenal were among a number of clubs interested in signing Guimaraes, who has also been watched closely by Manchester United and PSG. Guimaraes will wear the 39 shirt at Newcastle - the number of his father's taxi, which he drives in Brazil. It is the same number he had at Lyon. Guimaraes, who has been capped three times at international level by Brazil, comes into his own when his attacking qualities are examined. Not limited to merely carrying out defensive midfield duties, he is as effective in the opposition half and attacking areas, if not more effective. Guimaraes tops the ranking in Ligue 1 this season for passes completed in the opposition half and sits joint-top with Marseille's Dimitri Payet for passes completed in the final third. For context, Paris Saint-Germain's attacking stars, Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi, rank fourth and fifth, respectively, for this metric. The ability to find defence-splitting passes is illustrated by his high number of completed passes and chances created, while Guimaraes' fouls won, and touches statistics show there are few more effective carriers of the ball than the Brazilian currently playing in France. When you combine Guimaraes' attacking and defensive qualities it's clear Newcastle have identified a midfielder with genuine box-to-box qualities, a rare find at the best of times, let alone during a notoriously difficult January window which could be the difference between Premier League safety and relegation. Newcastle have agreed a fee of £13m with Brighton for defender Dan Burn. The defender is set to travel to the North East to undergo a medical. Newcastle had a second bid of £10m plus add-ons for Burn rejected on Saturday. The Magpies have wanted to sign a left-footed centre-back all window to partner Jamaal Lascelles. But they have so far failed in their attempts to sign Sven Botman, Diego Carlos and Benoit Badiashile, making Burn a top target in the final days of the window. The 29-year-old has entered the final 18 months of his Brighton contract. Burn, who joined Brighton from Wigan in 2018, can also play left-back. The Seagulls are extremely unlikely to sign a replacement centre-back this window. The clock is ticking. Who will be on the move before the transfer window closes at 11pm on Monday January 31?

Barcelona agreed a loan move with a £29m option to make the deal permanent, after Traore was left unconvinced by Tottenham's interest. A Barcelona statement read: ""FC Barcelona and Wolverhampton Wanderers have reached an agreement for the loan of the player Adama Traore until 30 June 2022. The blaugranes will pay the player's wages and there is an option to make the deal permanent. ""The presentation of Adama Traore as a new FC Barcelona player will be on Wednesday 2 February behind closed doors. The club will announce further details shortly."" Wolves' technical director, Scott Sellars, added: ""Adama has always acted with the utmost professionalism, however it is no secret that we have not been able to agree a new contract with him, despite protracted negotiations, and his desire at the moment is to play football elsewhere. ""Everyone knows Barcelona is a city, and club, very close to Adama's heart, so it is a dream move for him. We have also agreed a very healthy option in the deal should Barcelona wish to make the move permanent this summer. ""We wish Adama the best of luck in Spain, and hope that he plays regularly, has great success and shows everyone what he is capable of."" Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports Sky Sports News reported earlier this week that Spurs were closing in on a £20m deal for the 26-year-old after their previous bid of £15m was rejected, but Traore was not keen on the Premier League club's desire to use him in a variety of positions. He had been a long-time target of Spurs, who were in talks to sign Traore at the end of the summer transfer window. That interest remained despite the change of head coach from ex-Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo to Antonio Conte. Analysis by Sky Sports' Adam Bate: Missing out on Adama Traore represents a huge blow for Antonio Conte and Tottenham - this was a deal that was thought to be all but secured with the club keen to add further signings as well. Failure to land the Spain international leaves them with a problem. Traore had been identified to bring impetus at wing-back where Emerson Royal has lacked the creativity to beat a man in the opposition third. While Traore's defending has been questioned, nobody doubts his ball-carrying ability would have added a new dimension. The talk now is that he never fancied the position. Traore has only been used there in desperation by Bruno Lage - when trailing Brentford and Crystal Palace - and last had a run at wing-back under Nuno Espirito Santo in the autumn of 2019, with mixed results. More likely is that the interest from Barcelona changed his mind. Although Traore has spent the past six-and-a-half years in England, adapting well, Catalonia has always been home. He joined Barca's youth set-up aged eight and made his La Liga debut for the club at 17. The chance to return as an international player in his prime and ready to make an impact under his one-time team-mate Xavi Hernandez is an opportunity that he will have craved. Now he looks set to get that chance. For Tottenham, the search continues. The clock is ticking. Who will be on the move before the transfer window closes at 11pm on Monday January 31?

Arsenal and Tottenham were admirers of the 22-year-old but were unable to meet Fiorentina's asking price. The £66.6m deal for Vlahovic sees Juventus pay an initial €70m (£58.3m) to Fiorentina over the next three financial years and they will also pay €10m (£8.3m) in performance-related add-ons. Vlahovic will receive a gross salary of €7m (£5.8m) per season - a total of €31.5m (£26.2m) for the duration of his contract. Juve and Fiorentina had been in negotiations for some time over a fee for Vlahovic and finally agreed a price on Tuesday. Fiorentina wanted to sell Vlahovic, who was keen to move to Turin, this month to maximise their profit, as he had just 18 months remaining on his contract. Vlahovic came to prominence last season when he scored 21 goals in 40 appearances for Fiorentina, and has continued his impressive form with 20 goals in 24 games in all competitions this campaign.

""Arsenal were interested but it's thought that Vlahovic only wanted to go to Juventus.

They probably wanted to direct Vlahovic towards the English offers. ""The Fiorentina hierarchy have been very public about being open to selling Vlahovic in this transfer window, but they were also very public in saying, 'the agent and player are not coming back to us'. I think it was Fiorentina's way of putting the onus on Vlahovic, because they know the fans will be very disappointed to see him go to Juventus. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""But Fiorentina have been a bit hamstrung with this because he's only got 18 months left on his contract. They have offered him a new deal that would have made him the highest-paid player in Fiorentina's history. He didn't want to sign it."" Arsenal retained a strong interest in Vlahovic but ultimately found it difficult to complete a deal this month due to the size of the transfer fee needed to sign the striker. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has admitted there is a ""cloud"" hanging over Arsenal's forward options, with former captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang dropped for disciplinary reasons and Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah into the final six months of their contracts. Arteta has said the Gunners are working hard on new arrivals and that they ""are open"" to making a big signing if it is financially viable. Meanwhile, Sky Sports News reported in August Tottenham were interested in signing Vlahovic. Italian sources also said Vlahovic's preference was to join a side competing in the Champions League. Arsenal have not qualified for the competition for the past four seasons, while Spurs have not played in the competition since the 2019/20 season. Both clubs are currently two points off the top four. Vlahovic joined Fiorentina from Partizan Belgrade in 2018. As well as making an impression in Italy, the striker also has seven goals in 14 games for Serbia. ""I am the Zlatan Ibrahimovic of Belgrade, I will play for the biggest clubs.""

It was not long until the former Manchester City striker urged then-Fiorentina sporting director Italo Corvino to fork out £1.7m for his young understudy.

The 19-year-old winger joins the Scottish Premiership leaders until the end of the season, a year after he moved to Old Trafford. Diallo was signed by Manchester United in a deal worth £37.2m from Atalanta and has made nine appearances in all competitions, scoring one goal. United believe this move will be good for his development, with Diallo understood to be a part of the Premier League club's long-term plans. Diallo could make his debut at Ross County, live on Sky Sports, and said: ""I am delighted to join Rangers until the end of the season. ""It is fantastic for me at this stage of my career to have the opportunity to come to such a big club that is challenging on a number of fronts and will give me some excellent opportunities to test myself in many environments. ""I look forward to training with my teammates for the first-time tomorrow and to meeting the fans for the first time at Ross County on Saturday."" Rangers' Hagi to miss rest of season Exclusive: Morelos 'happy' at Rangers Transfer Centre LIVE! Get Sky Sports Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Manager, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, added: ""I am really pleased to add Amad to our squad for the rest of the season. ""He is a player who I have been aware of for some time, and when the opportunity to sign him came up, we were very keen to make it happen. ""He will add a lot to our squad and provide even more competition for the players in the forward areas."" Diallo's arrival follows the news winger Ianis Hagi will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery in London. Diallo was born in the Ivory Coast, before moving to Italy around the age of 10, joining Atalanta in 2015. The youngster made his debut for Atalanta in 2019, becoming the youngest player - at 17 years and 109 days old - to score on his Serie A debut in their 7-1 thrashing of Udinese. As a result, the Ivorian travelled with the Atalanta squad to Lisbon for their Champions League quarter-final defeat to Paris Saint-Germain. The player impressed in training so much so that Papu Gomez likened him to a certain Lionel Messi. ""There are defenders in the first team that sometimes cannot stop him. To stop him in training, we have to kick him! He plays like Messi,"" said Atalanta's captain before Diallo moved to United. Diallo was handed his Manchester United debut in a 4-0 win at Real Sociedad in the Europa League last February before going on to score his first goal for the club against AC Milan in the same competition a few weeks later. Sky Sports' Dan Sansom: ""One of the most exciting young prospects in the game"" is how Ole Gunnar Solskjaer described Diallo after signing him for Manchester United last year. The 19-year-old may not have had much first-team experience before making the move to Old Trafford, but he quickly made a big impression. Operating from both wings or in the No 10 role, Diallo will bring versatility and energy to Giovanni van Bronckhorst's side. Left-footed, he is most comfortable cutting in from the right but his ability to play multiple positions in the final third is one of his standout attributes. At just 5ft 8in, his size is no obstacle. The Ivory Coast international boasts significant strength on the ball and a low centre of gravity, as well as an impressive dribbling ability and eye for the right pass. Diallo is raw, but his fearlessness and enthusiasm could be key as Rangers chase a second consecutive Scottish Premiership title. The clock is ticking.

It follows several days of negotiations, in which Villa beat off interest from Chelsea, Newcastle and West Ham for the former Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona defender. Steven Gerrard brings in his second signing as manager following the arrival of his former Liverpool team-mate Philippe Coutinho, with Brighton's midfielder Yves Bissouma also a target. Gerrard told the club's website: ""When Lucas became available we jumped at the opportunity to bring him to the club.

I feel his desire to win, to show his football as a manager - the attacking football, the possession. ""I feel it's what I want and what I want to show to the fans."" Digne, who had three-and-a-half years remaining on his Everton contract, told the club he wanted to depart Goodison Park this month after falling out with manager Rafa Benitez. Digne appeared to take a parting shot at Benitez on Wednesday night in a farewell post to Evertonians, after the Spaniard made public his desire to leave last week. ""Everything must come to an end,"" Digne wrote on Instagram. ""I just did not expect it to end this way. What has happened and some things that was said about me in the last month has made me very sad. ""I will always carry you with me in my heart wherever I go. ""Sometimes it only takes one person from outside to destroy a beautiful love affair."" Sky Sports News had been told Everton wanted £30m for Digne, who joined from Barcelona in 2018. Everton have already signed Ukraine international Vitaliy Mykolenko as a replacement. The Toffees also secured the services of Rangers and Scotland right-back Nathan Patterson in a deal worth £16m earlier in the January window. So far this season, Digne has played 15 games and scored once for Everton, who are 15th in the table ahead of their clash away at Norwich on Saturday. Will Villa's two new signings play against Manchester United on Saturday? Watch live on Sky Sports Premier League from 5pm; kick-off 5:30pm. Sky Sports' Ben Grounds: Even in a depreciated market during these Covid times, the £25m fee that it is believed Aston Villa have spent in recruiting one of the Premier League's most creative full-backs merely highlights the precarious state Everton find themselves in. When more than £30m accounted for the signings of Vitalii Mykolenko and Nathan Patterson barely days into the January transfer window, supporters were encouraged by how proactive the club had been in addressing an area of weakness. But with 19 days left of the window remaining, and even taking into consideration the bridges burned between player and manager, allowing Digne to depart for such a modest sum can only serve to highlight how much the club are still in need of balancing books - not just severing ties. Still only 28 and with three-and-a-half years remaining on his contract, Digne is approaching his peak. With a World Cup later this year in Qatar, he was only too aware he couldn't jeopardise his place in Didier Deschamps' France squad. In that sense, it was a no-brainer to accelerate what began as a beautiful marriage into a bitter divorce. Aston Villa are going places under Steven Gerrard, sure. He has already shown his capabilities in improving his new side and the club have shown plenty of ambition by backing their manager in the market with the arrival of Philippe Coutinho on loan from Barcelona. Digne's partnership with the Brazilian down the left flank is an exciting prospect, but so too was being a mainstay at Everton, playing with the likes of Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin - at least in theory. Make no mistake: had Digne enjoyed a healthy relationship with Raphael Benitez, he would still be an Everton player and a future Everton captain. In spite of the contrasting moods at Goodison Park and Villa Park, only three points and a place separate the two clubs in the Premier League - but while Everton have a game in hand, these are two sides that appear to be heading in opposite directions. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player What this sorry saga leaves behind is an even more divided fanbase, who are right to question where the ongoing strategic review takes the club next. Patterson will hopefully blossom with Seamus Coleman the perfect mentor as an experienced right-back who has been at the club for more than 13 years but at 22, Mykolenko has no senior in his position to call upon for advice at a time when he is still grasping the language and has no experience of British football. The pressure has been increased on him as the club's apparent direct replacement for Digne to hit the ground running. But having won this particular power struggle, Benitez knows the ultimate power rests with the board. Having been backed, the scrutiny intensifies on him to bring about results. He takes his Everton side, with one league win in their last 13 games, to Norwich this weekend. Fail to win that, and that pressure could reach a tipping point.

Wood says he is ""delighted"" to have signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with the Magpies and is available to play in Saturday's Premier League match against relegation rivals Watford at St James' Park. ""I have played at St. James' Park a few times and it's an amazing place, so to have the chance to represent this club with those incredible supporters behind me and my team-mates is very special,"" Wood told the club website. ""The club and manager have been first class during this process, and I really can't wait to get onto the pitch and repay the faith they have in me, especially with a vital part of the season ahead of us."" Newcastle triggered the release clause in the 30-year-old's contract this week following the news top scorer Callum Wilson has been ruled out for eight weeks with a calf injury. Eddie Howe, the Newcastle head coach, praised the club for moving quickly to get Wood, who he says is an ""important signing for us at a crucial time"". ""He is a very dangerous attacking threat, has a physicality and character that I really like, and he has vast experience in the Premier League. He will be a great fit for us,"" added Howe.

Get Sky Sports Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player He becomes Newcastle's second signing this month after Kieran Trippier arrived for £12m from Spanish side Atletico Madrid. Wood had been a key player for relegation rivals Burnley, who sit just above Newcastle on goal difference in the bottom three, and started 19 games for the Clarets this season. The New Zealand international, with three goals for Burnley this campaign, has vast experience of playing in the Premier League and could slot into the starting line-up as Newcastle prepare for a crucial home match with Watford on Saturday. Burnley did not plan to sell Wood but had no choice to accept Newcastle's offer after it met the striker's release clause. However, the Clarets are understood to have two targets in mind to replace the striker, both of whom are based abroad. Sean Dyche wants to add pace in attack and is targeting versatile players that can play across the frontline. The signing of Maxwel Cornet - who has six goals in 13 games since signing from Lyon last summer - is an example of the club moving away from their traditional profile of player towards a more dynamic and flexible attack.

El Ghazi becomes Everton's third signing of the January transfer window after the arrivals of Ukraine left-back Vitalii Mykolenko and Scotland right-back Nathan Patterson. The former Ajax player will wear the number 34 shirt for the Toffees and is eligible for Saturday's Premier League trip to Norwich. El Ghazi had been used solely as a substitute since manager Steven Gerrard arrived at Villa Park in November, and competition for places has only intensified for the Dutchman this month following the arrival of Philippe Coutinho. The 26-year-old has scored just one goal in nine Premier League appearances this season. Villa signed El Ghazi initially on loan from French club Lille in 2018, before making it permanent a year later after he scored a vital goal in the play-off final win over Derby to secure Premier League promotion. El Ghazi's move to Everton from Aston Villa comes swiftly on the back of Lucas Digne's switch in the other direction after the left-back moved to Villa Park for £25m on Thursday. Transfer Centre LIVE! January transfer window: Done deals January transfer window: Club-by-club deals Paper Talk Speaking to evertontv, El Ghazi said: ""I'm really excited. Everton is a big club, I cannot wait to get started. ""I've met a few fans already and it's great to see how people live for the club. It's basically their religion. You just want to give it your all and show them what you can do to make them happy. ""I just want to focus on working hard, getting into the team, fighting for my place and, with the boys, to get Everton where it belongs - that is much higher up the table. We have a really good squad. ""I've played at Goodison Park a few times now and it's a beautiful stadium. ""It's a bit different than other stadiums and that's what makes it quite unique. I'm really looking forward to playing there for Everton. ""We have a really strong squad. The wingers are doing well and have a lot of quality. It will be hard work but competition with others is good and that is how you achieve great things. ""I will work hard and give everything I have. That is the least you can expect from a player. That is what I will start with and from there hopefully, I will be able to score goals and give assists."" Who will be on the move in January?

The England right-back has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with the option of a further year. Trippier flew into Tyneside on Wednesday in a private jet following the conclusion of smooth and positive talks between the two clubs on Tuesday. The club are paying £12m plus add-ons to make the 31-year-old the first signing under Newcastle's Saudi owners. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Newcastle have been granted clearance regarding Trippier's availability and he will be able to make his debut for the team against Cambridge United in the FA Cup third round on Saturday. Magpies boss Eddie Howe worked with Trippier while in charge of Burnley, signing the right-back from Manchester City in January 2012 after an impressive loan spell at Turf Moor. Atletico hoped Trippier would stay, but the former Tottenham defender made it clear he wanted to return to England. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports The Spanish champions are now considering making a move for Arsenal right-back Cedric Soares as a replacement for Trippier. The proposed deal would be a loan with an obligation for Atletico to make the deal permanent. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In his first press conference after signing for the club, Trippier downplayed any suggestion that financial reasons were involved in his decision to move to Newcastle. ""People say it's about money? They're entitled to their opinion,"" the defender said. ""My family are most important. I wanted a project and a challenge. I'm brave, I don't see this as a risk. I've got my reasons, I know them, and money isn't one of them. I'm excited."" The full-back said he feels ""no pressure"" in being the first addition under Newcastle's new owners, and is also interested in making his way back into England manager Gareth Southgate's plans. ""I'm still ambitious and I still want to get into the England team - I know I'm up against Reece James, Kyle Walker and Trent (Alexander-Arnold) and I think I can still handle the pressure."" Trippier admitted that Newcastle's ""main aim"" for this season would be to ""stay in the Premier League"" but added that there is excitement around the club's long-term project which he is happy to be a part of. The 31-year-old believes he can ""be a leader in the dressing room with my experience"" and wants to ""help as much as I can on and off the pitch."" Howe added: ""I am really pleased to welcome Kieran to Newcastle United. I have long admired his abilities and have followed his career, so when the opportunity arose to secure him, we didn't hesitate. ""A lot of hard work has gone into planning for the January transfer window long before the month began, which is clear in how quickly we have been able to complete this move."" Newcastle's owners hope to recruit at least three more players this month as they look to keep the club in the Premier League. They have submitted an improved offer for Lille defender Sven Botman. Botman, who is valued at over £25m (€30m) and has three years left on his deal, is Newcastle's primary centre-back target. Norwich City midfielder Todd Cantwell is another target, but they face competition from an unnamed Premier League club. Newcastle are second-bottom in the table and two points from safety after 19 league matches this season. Sky Sports' Dharmesh Sheth: ""It looks like Botman is keen on this move. On Instagram there are various posts on this story, saying Newcastle have made an improved offer, and one of the likes came from Botman. Read into that what you will. ""Lille do not want to sell, but they have got financial problems. So, is there a situation where they could be forced into selling. ""There was one contact I have spoken too who has contacts at Lille and he said it is a case of when and not if players like Botman, Jonathan David and Renato Sanches leave the club, but his understanding was that it would more likely be in the summer. ""But if Newcastle come up with an offer that Lille would have to look at and say we can't refuse it, don't rule this one out."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol told The Transfer Show: ""It's fantastic news for Newcastle fans. ""I think other players that have been contacted by Newcastle will now be looking at Kieran Trippier and thinking, 'Well, he's an England international, he is going to make that squad much stronger, he's improved their chances of staying up. Maybe I should be looking at that as well. If he's up for it, maybe I should be up for it as well'. ""It will be difficult for Newcastle to sign other players, but I think they definitely will, especially from what Keith Downie and Pete Graves are telling us. They're in the market for other players, I think they will be trying to do loan deals as well, but it's a fantastic start to the window for Newcastle. ""It's also really significant that they've done this early in the window, because we know they've got some big, big games coming up and Kieran Trippier is 100 per cent fit, and it looks like he is 100 per cent committed and up for the challenge."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Peter Smith: Newcastle set an unwanted record in 2021: the 80 goals they conceded was the most ever recorded in a calendar year by a Premier League team. This season, in their first 19 matches, they have let in 42 - only eight sides have ever let in more at that stage in the Premier League. That leakiness has proved costly, with Newcastle dropping more points from winning positions than any other side in this campaign. Throw in the fact that Newcastle have allowed more shots on their goal than any other Premier League team this term and the picture is plain: this is a defence which badly needs reinforcements in January. Eddie Howe - who has not been able to orchestrate a significant improvement in that department since taking over from Steve Bruce - has turned to a familiar face for help. Howe coached Trippier for two seasons in the Championship when both were at Burnley 10 years ago. Since then Trippier has gone on to become one of Europe's top right-backs, reaching a Champions League final with Tottenham before winning La Liga last season with Atletico Madrid, where Diego Simeone's coaching has improved his defensive skills. Trippier's reliability and creativity from crosses and set-pieces have made him a favourite of England boss Gareth Southgate, too, who turned to him at key moments throughout the team's run to the Euro 2020 final last summer before handing him the captain's armband for the World Cup qualifier with Andorra in October. Trippier will add leadership, experience and quality to the backline. Newcastle will need strengthening in other areas too but it is a transfer that boosts their hopes of securing Premier League survival. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Former Newcastle defender Steve Howey told Sky Sports: ""We knew the interest from Newcastle towards Trippier before the transfer window. Fans were a little bit apprehensive before it got across the line, but it's an amazing signing. ""I think he's a fantastic player and he's a great acquisition for the club. Let's just hope he's one of a few that comes through in this January window. ""How many windows during Mike Ashley's tenure did Newcastle not even feature? They've never been linked with anybody so for the new owners to come in and do what they said they were going to do is fantastic news and there's a fair few days left in the market to attract quality players as that's what the team needs. ""They're in a poor predicament so he has to be only the first if the club are going to stay in the Premier League.""

The agreement, which is subject to the player completing a medical and receiving a work permit, also includes an option to buy and Coutinho will travel to Birmingham in the next 48 hours. Villa are paying less than 50 per cent of Coutinho's weekly wage, plus bonuses, Sky Sports News has been told, and he even agreed to a pay cut, with other clubs offering deals that would have seen him earn 100 per cent of his Barca wage. Coutinho wanted to return to England and play regular football and sees Villa as an ambitious club that are building something special for the future. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The Brazil midfielder knows manager Steven Gerrard well having spent two-and-a-half years with him at Liverpool, and is said to already know a lot about Villa and their squad. Villa have an option to buy Coutinho for £33m in the summer. One source told Sky Sports News there was also a chance Coutinho could have returned to Liverpool this month and that he would have been open to the move. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports However, it is understood Liverpool were not pursuing a move for the 29-year-old during the January transfer window. Coutinho was signed by Barcelona from Liverpool for a club-record £146m in January 2018, but he has struggled to hold down a first-team place at the Nou Camp and spent the 2019/20 season on loan at Bayern Munich. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In terms of outgoings, Villa striker Wesley has joined Brazilian side Internacional on loan for the rest of the season. Speaking on Thursday ahead of signing Coutinho, manager Steven Gerrard said: ""Sixty-three caps for Brazil, a serial winner, was incredible at Liverpool, so I can understand why he's linked to a lot of football clubs,"" said Gerrard. ""I can understand why a lot of supporters up and down the country are speaking about him. I don't think you get a nickname as a magician if you're not a special footballer, so he's someone I have an incredible amount of respect for. ""But I don't want to add to any speculation, because he belongs to Barcelona."" Jack Grealish once commented Philippe Coutinho was one of his favourite players to watch on YouTube. ""He always has that one, you know, where he goes left and drops like a little shimmy, which is what I like doing myself."" Now the journey has come full circle. While Grealish perfected his art enough to earn a £100m move to Manchester City, Coutinho returns to the Premier League to replace him at Aston Villa. If the Brazilian can repeat the form that took him from Liverpool to Barcelona it will be an ideal signing.  There are similarities between the two players. Grealish praised Coutinho's ability to ""go past players like they aren't there"" and that is what Villa so loved about their former captain. They have missed having that player who can make things happen this season. Is the Coutinho idolised by Grealish still there? At 29, there is time to recapture his best form under old team-mate Steven Gerrard, but his career has drifted at Barcelona. If, like Grealish, Coutinho is inspired by being the main man at Villa Park, there is fun to be had.  Who will be on the move in January?

125,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12691/12508957/nathan-patterson-everton-sign-right-back-from-rangers-in-16m-deal,Nathan Patterson: Everton sign right-back from Rangers in £16m deal,"Nathan Patterson has completed his move from Rangers to Everton in a deal worth £16m. The right-back has signed a five-and-a-half-year contract at Goodison Park and becomes the club's second signing of the January transfer window following defender Vitaliy Mykolenko's arrival from Dynamo Kiev. Rangers had rejected two bids from Everton in the summer, insisting their valuation had not been met for the academy graduate who made his Gers debut in January 2020. However, Rafa Benitez made a third move for Patterson early in this transfer window which will earn Rangers a club record initial fee of around £12m, with further add-ons worth £4m. ""I'm over the moon to sign for Everton and looking forward to getting started,"" Patterson told evertontv. ""It was an easy choice to sign. This is a massive club with huge history and the fanbase is tremendous. Obviously we aren't in the place where we want to be right now but we can definitely get there with the talent in the changing room and staff here, and I have full belief we can do that. ""It is really exciting to come to a club that has huge talent in the team. I am going to work my socks off and hopefully I can do well with them in training and in games. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports ""It was also great for me knowing the manager really wanted me here and that made my decision. When a club really wants you, it makes your mind up early on. ""I wanted to come here from the very start. I'm delighted to be here and really looking forward to playing in front of the fans at Goodison. ""Long-term, I want to nail down a starting position and win some trophies to make the fans proud."" Patterson - who will wear the number three jersey at Everton - had started in just two of his six Scottish Premiership appearances this season, with captain James Tavernier the Rangers' first-choice right-back. He made his Scotland debut last June during a 1-0 win over Luxembourg before scoring his first goal for the national side against Moldova in November. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Former Rangers defender Craig Moore told Sky Sports: ""Nathan was struggling to get his starts with Tavernier playing in his position. Giovanni van Bronckhorst has been trying to get him into the team, played him as a left full-back, it didn't work and he's a senior international player now. ""I think for the amount of money that they're talking about, potentially going up to £16m, I think it's the right move for both parties. Nathan has done extremely well, showed great promise and think everybody would understand he just wants to play football. ""At the moment the risk is Everton's. Rangers getting that type of money in in fantastic business. Everton have the risk of the player hitting that potential but, for me, he's the type of player who can play and do well in England then you're talking £40-50m. ""I think it's a really good investment for Everton. You'll need to be patient as he's a younger boy but as we've seen he's desperate to play football and, more importantly, he's ready."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Sahil Jaidka: Some Blues fans might question why the club have splashed out on a 20-year-old who has started just two Scottish Premiership games this season. The answer - potential. When Everton came calling for Patterson in the summer, the then Rangers manager Steven Gerrard labelled an initial offer of £5m as a ""joke"" - a sign of how highly the right-back is rated. Since graduating from the Ibrox academy and making his Gers debut in January 2020, Patterson has gone on to break into the Scotland set-up too where he has earned six caps - and praise from head coach Steve Clarke. He has developed into a fearless, fast, ball-carrying full-back who is dangerous in attack and has occasionally been used by Giovanni van Bronckhorst as a winger or at left-back. Standing at over 6ft the youngster is strong in the air too and not afraid of putting in a tackle - a trait that saw him become a fans favourite at Ibrox. Over the past 12 months, Patterson has also shown he has an eye for goal after scoring against Royal Antwerp, Cove Rangers and for Scotland against Moldova. Asked what Evertonians can expect from him, Patterson said: ""Athleticism, desire and strong challenges, along with good forward play. I am an attacking full-back. I love getting forward and creating chances to benefit the team. I can't wait for it."" For what he lacks in experience, Patterson has shown he makes up for that in ability. Patterson would undoubtedly have more Rangers appearances to his name, were it not for captain James Tavernier's brilliance. The 30-year-old has been a standout for the Scottish Premiership champions at right-back, missing just two league games this season after a Covid outbreak and has impressed at both ends of the park. Tavernier has scored four Premiership goals so far this season, a third of what he achieved last campaign and has already bettered the number of assists. It was a near-impossible task to replace Rangers' captain but the fact van Bronckhorst has tried to play Patterson in other areas shows how highly the Scotland international is regarded. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ibrox managing director Stewart Robertson recently said the club were on the cusp of financial stability with Rangers' player-trading model key for the future. While there was no need to sell any players in this window, despite posting a £23.5m operating loss last season, cashing in on an asset like Patterson for a club-record fee makes sense. Rangers have rejected previous bids for Patterson while interest in Alfredo Morelos and Ryan Kent has also been rebuffed with the club only entertaining offers that meet their valuation. With Joe Aribo and Glen Kamara also catching the eye of other clubs, arguably Patterson's departure is the least damaging to Rangers' starting XI as they aim to retain their title which could bring with it a potential £40m Champions League windfall. Sky Sports' Ben Grounds: 2022 has so far been a continuation of the malaise under Rafael Benitez. The home defeat to Brighton taught supporters nothing new as a second-half fightback following another slow start was too little, too late. New year, same old problems. On the pitch, Everton have been uninspiring but off it, they are making up for lost time. The signing of Patterson, four days on from confirming the capture of Mykolenko means the club have already forked out around £30m on two full-backs. Everton have invested in potential. Mykolenko has signed a four-and-a-half-year contract while Patterson doesn't turn 21 until next October. Both have been signed with a view of becoming mainstays in a defence that has needed tightening. The right-back position has proven problematic for some time, even before Benitez had his own chance to assess a fractured squad. During the 2013/14 season under Roberto Martinez, Everton achieved their best Premier League tally of 72 points with arguably the best full-back pairing in the division: Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman. But by the time Martinez left in 2016, his successor Ronald Koeman had already sought to provide Coleman with competition by signing Cuco Martina. It didn't work. Then after the short-lived Sam Allardyce rescue act at the end of 2017/18, Marco Silva drafted in Djibril Sidibe at the start of his second season in 2019. Again, this was only a temporary fix with the on-loan Monaco right-back failing to secure a permanent move. Carlo Ancelotti would replace Silva, but the Italian allowed Jonjoe Kenny to go out on loan to Celtic without providing cover for Coleman. Ben Godfrey, Mason Holgate and even Alex Iwobi were trialled in this position. It led to Iwobi taking to social media to vent his frustration over not being played in his preferred position. To compound matters, persistent niggles to Coleman - at 33 - made it clear his minutes needed better management. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The summer transfer window passed with further frustration as Ainsley Maitland-Niles was blocked from joining while another target Denzel Dumfries opted to sign for Inter Milan. Patterson was by then firmly on Everton's radar but the club have now finally identified and acted on an area of weakness that will go some way to appeasing a disgruntled and divided fanbase. On linking up with manager Benitez and Everton's long-serving right-back and captain Coleman, Patterson added: ""I'm really looking forward to working under the manager and with my teammates. I have met most of them already and everyone has made me feel so welcome. ""I've had a good conversation with Seamus. I am really looking forward to learning from him and working together.""That is why I am here: to learn and get better as a player and, hopefully, win things and do well for the club. If I am working alongside Seamus that is definitely going to happen.""

""English football is where the game was born and I think that it will suit my game very well,"" he said. ""I am 22 but I don't feel like a youngster. I have experience of playing at European level and hope I will continue to improve as a player. ""I am excited about the opportunity of playing in front of our supporters at Everton.

The Spain forward has joined Barca on a five-year deal until 2027 and the club have set his buyout clause at €1billion (£841,735,504.40m). Barca will pay an initial £46.3m (€55m) plus a further £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons for the forward. Some £5.9m (€7m) of those add-ons are said to be more or less guaranteed. The Spanish club agreed a deal to sign Torres from City in the week leading up to Christmas. The 21-year-old is regarded by Barcelona as one of Spain's most promising talents. They are able to spend in January after recently receiving sizeable investment via a bank loan. The club have said Torres will be officially unveiled at the Nou Camp and shall attend his first training session and press conference on January 3. Torres joined City for an initial fee of £20.8m plus bonuses on a five-year deal in August 2020 but has played only four times in the Premier League this season, scoring twice, and once more in the Champions League. Barcelona fixtures Latest Man City news Premier League table How to watch Premier League highlights Torres departs the Etihad Stadium having scored 16 goals in 43 appearances for City in all competitions. He also helped Pep Guardiola's team to the Premier League and Carabao Cup last season. He has been sidelined since October with a foot injury suffered on international duty with Spain. City's director of football Txiki Begiristain said: ""Ferran should be proud of what he has achieved here at Manchester City. ""Last season was his first time in a new country, but he adapted well. He always gave 100 per cent, worked hard for the team and scored goals which helped us win trophies. ""Injury unfortunately prevented him from playing more games this season, but Ferran is a player we have all enjoyed working with and we wish him all the best at Barcelona and for the rest of his career."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Torres' arrival in Catalonia comes with former City team-mate Sergio Aguero having announced his retirement earlier in December after being diagnosed with a heart condition just months following his move to Barca. Prior to his move to City, Torres attracted interest from Barca, Real Madrid and some of Europe's top clubs as a result of his exploits at Valencia. A graduate of Valencia's academy, he made his first-team debut in 2017 and went on to score nine times in 97 matches and helped them to the Copa del Rey in the 2018/19 season.

From retro designs to bold, graphic prints, keep track of all the fresh looks as they are released. Arsenal's home kit for the 2020/21 season pays homage to the Gunners' geometric crest which the club used between 1936 and 1949. Manufacturer Adidas have retained the iconic red shirt with white sleeves, but the body features a chevron graphic which is inspired by the 'A' within. There is also a nod to the layout of the tiling on the floors of the famous East Stand at Arsenal's former Highbury home. Adidas has also revealed Arsenal's away kit for the 2020/21 season, a marble-influenced shirt with hand drawn design, inspired by the club's iconic East Stand at Highbury. Famous for its prestigious marble halls, Highbury was Arsenal's home from 1913, although the art deco East and West Stands were reconstructed in the 1930s. Get Sky Sports Premier League table Premier League results Premier League top scorers Listed by the time Arsenal moved to Emirates Stadium in 2006, parts of the stands were retained in the housing development that replaced the stadium, including the facade of the East Stand which was famed for its marble interior. The new kit replicates the natural pattern of the marble in maroon and black print on white. Arsenal have also released their new third strip, which will be worn on the pitch for the first time in the Premier League season opener against Fulham on Saturday. The new shirt colours represent the lights and atmosphere that illuminate the Emirates during a night match. The shirt pattern was created from a custom set of tie dye prints. After securing Premier League survival, Villa released their new home kit on August 1, sticking with Kappa as the kit sponsor and changing to Cazoo as the club sponsor. It's the classic claret and blue design, featuring dark pinstripes down the body, with white shorts and blue socks. Featuring a Stadium and Pro edition of the shirt, the latter is dedicated to elite performance, according to the club. Villa's away kit is black, a colour they opted for in 2017/18 and 2010/11. Brighton released their new 2020/21 home kit before the end of last season, and wore it on their final day win against Burnley. The Nike shirt is inspired by a design previously used in 1983/84 and 1993/94 for two seasons each time, with a solid blue shirt and white pinstripes. It will be paired with white shorts and blue socks. Brighton's away kit is a 1980s-inspired yellow and blue number, which was worn in a pre-season friendly against Chelsea. Burnley's new home kit takes inspiration from the one worn by one of the greatest squad of players in the club's history: the 1920/1921 League Championship winners of 100 years ago. Developed by Umbro, the home shirt features a blue collar with a stylised 'cut' neckline, while the traditional blue sleeves sit lower on the arm. Nike says Chelsea's new home and away kit feature the club's new sponsor, telecommunications company Three, and is inspired by London's ""long association with master tailors and their exquisite craftsmanship"". The blue home jersey features a herringbone pattern, as well as a dark blue round collar and sleeve trim. The navy trim extends down the side of the shirt and shorts, while the socks are white. The away jersey, meanwhile, ""adds an injection of millennial swagger - perfect for the confident, emerging talents lighting up Stamford Bridge under head coach Frank Lampard"", it's claimed. Chelsea's third kit draws inspiration from the 1990s, with Nike also taking a leaf out of the design of the original Nike Air Max 180 from that era. The colour combination is described as ultramarine, ember glow and white to reference vintage Chelsea away kits. Crystal Palace and Puma have kept it symmetrical for 2020/21; all three kits share the same design pattern - with stripes rising up the chest - for the first time since their promotion campaign of 2012/13. The Eagles' away kit is white, while a black number will serve as their third strip. Everton have unveiled their 2020/21 home strip from new kit-maker hummel. The Toffees' traditional royal blue jersey features hummel's chevrons across the shoulders and sleeves and pays tribute to the club's iconic Z-Cars anthem with an image of the song's soundbar embossed diagonally across the shirt. Shorts and socks are white, with blue chevron contrast. The Toffees' away kit is a classic amber and blue design inspired by the second strips worn in the late 1960s and early 1970s, while their third kit is described as a ""seafoam"" colour. Leeds are back in the big time after 16 years say and their new adidas home kit is a crisp white design with royal blue stripes on the sleeves. Leeds' away kit takes inspiration from its change strip from 1994-96, with the club saying they hope to bring back memories of Tony Yeboah's opening-day volley winner against West Ham on the opening day of 1995/96 and his UEFA Cup hat-trick against Monaco by recreating the blue-and-green-striped shirt. Leeds have released thier maroon third shirt with a tonal front pattern design and the famous three stripes line the shoulders in gold. The v-neck design has the Leeds badge in gold, complete with maroon shorts and socks tipped with gold. Leicester's new adidas home kit features ""'90s-inspired design features"" including a ribbed V-neck, sleeve taping and gold accents. Premier League shirts will carry the words 'Thailand Smiles With You' - a club initiative to support the country's recovery from the pandemic - while 'King Power' will feature on the front of shirts worn in cup and European competition. Leicester have released two alternative kits - in maroon and white. Premier League champions Liverpool have unveiled their home and away kits for next season, which are the first of their new partnership with Nike. Liverpool's home shirt for the new season features a v-neck collar with a subtle teal and white trim in a nod to the club's history. Teal and white - which also adorns the sleeves of the new home shirt - are colours that have been used throughout the club's history since 1892. Virgil van Dijk said: ""Stepping out as champions next season in this kit will be really special."" Liverpool's away kit is teal, with the shirt featuring a graphic print and black detailing. The shorts are plain teal, with a black stripe down the side. Liverpool's third kit, released on the eve of the season, is a black and charcoal grey checkerboard design, which the club say is inspired by famous European away nights. All three shirts feature a '96' emblem, encased by eternal flames, on the nape of the neck, in memory of the 96 children, women and men who lost their lives at Hillsborough. Man City's new Puma home kit features a ""mosaic"" pattern shirt is a tribute to the city's ""melting pot of art, industry, music, fashion, noise and colour"". The kit is completed with white shorts and light blue socks. The away shirt features a dark blue and black shirt with copper detailing, while the third kit is an eye-catching pastel paisley number. Manchester United's new home kit is inspired by the club's crest, utilising gold and black lines on the famous red jersey. The badge will return to the traditional colours of red and gold with black trim after a switch to a gold badge on a black background last season. The inspiration comes from the ""Manchester United DNA"" which has been a focus for manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with white stripes down the arms and a rounded neck. Man Utd's away kit features, they say, a 'legend earth green' pattern, made up of an intricately hand-drawn and painted design. Their third kit is a striking zebra-style affair with red trim and collar detail to mark 110 years at Old Trafford. Newcastle United have revealed their fresh Puma kit for 2020/21. The Magpies wore it for the first time in their final-day assignment against Premier League champions Liverpool. The Adidas kit features the club's iconic black and white stripes with thinner vertical bands ""that maintains a classic Newcastle United look"". The Magpies will be in yellow on the road for the first time since 2013/14, with a patterned 'fizzy yellow' shirt featuring a peacoat blue stripe across the shoulders. The club's new third kit is an eye-catching 'prism violet' design, featuring a bold pattern based on the steelwork of the famous Tyne Bridge. Sheffield United's home kit features the club's iconic red and white stripes, with the addition a white panel at the top of the shirt and along the arms. A new-look shirt collar will also now be in black, as will the shorts, while the socks will be red. The Blades will catch the eye on the road; a light pink shirt and socks are paired with grey shorts. Kitmaker Under Armour has marked Southampton's 135th anniversary with the return of the club's iconic sash kit first worn back in 1885. The new strip - featuring a white sash on a red shirt - was worn in a final-day win over Sheffield United. Southampton's away kit harks back to the navy colour used for the team's shorts and socks throughout much of its early history, from 1891 all the way through to 1950. Accents of yellow and solent blue are a nod to the club's 1976 FA Cup final victory. Tottenham have released new Nike home and away kits - both constructed with recycled polyester fabric from old plastic bottles - that they say represent ""a modern streetwear style, using exciting new colours and bold graphics"". A traditional white home shirt this year features a knit pattern, with blocks of blue on the shoulder and a yellow pinstripe around a v-neck collar. Blue shorts and white socks - also with yellow accents - complete the look. A dark green away kit features flashes of neon pink and yellow. Tottenham's third kit returns to a yellow reminiscent of famous Spurs kits of the past - including their FA Cup Final victory in 1982 - with Nike also including a link to their own Air Max 95 shoes. Newly-promoted West Brom are with Puma again, and for the third straight season have opted for a green and yellow away shirt, along with a different take on navy and white stripes for their home kit. Both shirts feature the 'barcode' design, reportedly drawing inspiration from one of the club's most popular seasons, the 1992/93 promotion from Division Two, and the third kit follow suit; there will be no missing the Baggies in this red and yellow number. The new West Ham home kit for 2020/21 celebrates the club's 125th anniversary with a classic design. The Umbro shirt features a claret body with blue sleeves and a blue crew-neck collar, as well as a commemorative two-colour crest. Shorts and socks are white. The Hammers' away kit is inspired by the Club's golden period of the 1960s and features two claret bands on blue, while the club's third kit is black with gold detail. Wolves' new home kit, manufactured by adidas, reverts back to the gold shirt, black shorts and gold socks combination. The shirt features a tonal graphic. Wolves away shirt features an unusual cloud design with more familiar gold and black trim, while their third kit is green with red trim. Another year, another £50,000 jackpot on the line.

Balogun underwent a medical on Tuesday ahead of finalsing his move to the Championship side, who will pay a portion of his wages. The 20-year-old striker has not featured in the Premier League since August but remains a part of Arsenal's long-term plans and signed a new contract in April which ties him to the club until 2025. Middlesbrough boss Chris Wilder tried to sign Balogun - who was born in New York - back in 2020 when he was in charge of Sheffield United. Wilder told Middlesbrough's club website: ""We're delighted to get Flo in. He's a player I've known about for a long time and we identified him as someone who could come in and improve us in the second half of the season. ""He has great movement, good pace, and he's a natural finisher. We're looking forward to working with him."" Balogun was also the subject of interest from Europe, with French Ligue 1 side Saint-Etienne among the clubs who were monitoring his situation. Transfer Centre LIVE!

The Arsenal academy graduate, whose contract expires in the summer of 2023, has started just two Premier League games this season but will hope he can kickstart his career under former Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho in Italy, alongside former Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham. ""I am just delighted to be here and can't wait to crack on. I want to help the team and show what I can do as a player,"" England international Maitland-Niles said. ""Thank you to the fans for the support they have already shown me - I hope we can go on to do something great by the end of the season."" Mourinho will be hoping the utility player, deployed at wing-back and central midfield, can make an impact after an inconsistent start to the season has left Roma seventh after 20 games, six points outside the top four. Maitland-Niles began the season by publicly pleading for a transfer exit in the final days of the summer window after interest from Everton, writing on Instagram: ""All I wanna do is go where I'm wanted and where I'm gonna play."" But after holding clear-the-air talks with manager Mikel Arteta it was decided the 24-year-old midfielder would stay until at least January and fight for his place in the team. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports Maitland-Niles has since struggled for consistent game time this season - at full-back and in central midfield - and it has been decided he will leave on loan for a second consecutive season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Speaking ahead of Sunday's FA Cup tie at Nottingham Forest, the Gunners manager said: ""Ainsley came to me and explained reasons why he thought the best thing for his career is to move away and the opportunity in Rome and working under Jose (Mourinho) was good one. ""We already had this conversation in the summer and said to reassess in December. When a player has strong argument like he had, it's very difficult to turn him away. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We're very shot at the moment, but this shouldn't be the only reason for keeping a player. Ainsley has been developed and raised through our academy and was very patient in many moments in trying to fulfil his dream. ""He was very straight with me and I understood the situation. Obviously, we're going to move and look for options as we're very shot there."" Last winter, he was recruited by Sam Allardyce to play for West Brom, who were eventually relegated. Sky Sports' Nick Wright: Maitland-Niles' Premier League playing time this season amounts to just 265 minutes but Arsenal's willingness to let him leave midway through the season is surprising nonetheless. The Gunners are, after all, about to lose both Thomas Partey and Mohamed Elneny to Africa Cup on Nations duty, leaving Granit Xhaka and Albert Sambi Lokonga as their only senior options. Maitland-Niles would surely have been useful during that period, especially given Arsenal's hectic schedule, but instead they have granted him his wish for more regular playing time. It may indicate Arsenal are preparing to bring in midfield reinforcements from elsewhere this month. For Maitland-Niles, meanwhile, the question is whether he can make his long-desired transformation from versatile squad member to regular starter under the guidance of Jose Mourinho over in Italy.

Kozlowski, who had been linked with other Premier League clubs, joins Brighton from Polish top-flight side Pogon Szczecin, and heads straight out on loan to Union St-Gilloise. Union St-Gilloise are owned by Brighton chair Tony Bloom and are currently top of the Belgian Pro League. Kozlowski came through the ranks with Pogon, making his first-team debut at just 15 years and 215 days old in a 3-0 win over Cracovia. He has gone on to make 40 league appearances for Pogon, scoring four goals. Brighton technical director Dan Ashworth said: ""He is a bright young talent and we're very pleased to have completed the signing of Kacper, who has made a lot of progress in his career at a very early stage. ""The initial plan for Kacper in the short-term will be for him to spend the rest of the season out on loan with Union. David Weir and his team will monitor his progress there."" Head coach Graham Potter added: ""His style of play suits us and our style. During my time here, we have done very well in recruiting players for the future and Kacper is a similar signing.

The 26-year-old joins the La Liga side - who will pay his wages in full - until the end of the season. There is no loan fee involved. Martial flew from Paris to Seville on Tuesday to undergo a medical. The forward always wanted to join Sevilla this month, despite interest from Juventus and Barcelona, because he believes that is where he will play the most. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports News exclusively broke the news in December Martial wanted to leave United in search of more game time. Martial became the world's most expensive teenager when he joined United from Monaco in 2015 and went on to score 79 times in 269 appearances for the club. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  But he fell out of favour in the forward positions following the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho in the summer, as well as the emergence of Mason Greenwood. Transfer Centre LIVE! January transfer window: Done deals January transfer window: Club-by-club deals Paper Talk Martial has started just four games for United this season, and was accused by Ralf Rangnick, the club's interim manager, of asking not to play in the 2-2 draw at Aston Villa on January 15. The France international refuted his manager's claim, and Rangnick later insisted the situation was ""resolved"". Following Saturday's 2-2 draw at home to Celta Vigo, Sevilla are second in La Liga and just four points behind Real Madrid as they search for their first title since 1946. European football expert Tom Williams spoke to the Transfer Talk podcast last week about why Martial has been unable to hold down a first-team place at Old Trafford, and revealed which two team-mates he thinks have been holding back the forward... ""There are various reasons for him not having hit the heights that United would have hoped. There's been a lot of instability since he came to the club. He's played under four different managers, not all of whom have been his biggest fans - you think notoriously of Jose Mourinho. ""He's had injury problems. There's debate about his best position - is he best on the left or is he best through the middle? ""There's obviously competition for places at United. I think one of the things that perhaps gets overlooked a bit is how unfortunate Marcus Rashford's emergence has been for Martial, because they're such similar players. But also you've got Mason Greenwood, you've got (Edinson) Cavani and now Cristiano Ronaldo. ""But ultimately you're just not sure how much he wants it. I'm always loathed to judge players on their body language but he's a maddening player to watch, particularly given the amount of ability he has. He's so inconsistent. ""When they came out of lockdown and finished the 2019/20 season, Martial was one of the absolute stars. But last season was a bit of a write-off and now he's out of the picture. ""He obviously needs to move. Ronaldo arriving was probably the death knell for his United career as the first-choice centre-forward. You suspect that, for both parties, the best thing is for him to move on.""

Ndombele - who became Spurs' record signing when he joined from Lyon for £63m in July 2019 - has returned to Lyon to bring an end to his disappointing spell at Tottenham. The Ligue 1 side have paid a £1.2m loan fee and retain the option to make the deal permanent in the summer for a reported £54m. Ndombele will help to replace Bruno Guimaraes, who joined Newcastle for £40m on Sunday. Tottenham released a brief, 46-word statement to announce Ndombele's exit, which featured none of the usual pleasantries handed out by a club when a player leaves. ""Tanguy Ndombele has joined Ligue 1 side Olympique Lyonnais on loan until the end of the season,"" said Spurs. ""The central midfielder returns to the club from which he joined us in July 2019. He has made 91 appearances for us in all competitions to date, scoring 10 goals."" Ndombele started just three games for Spurs following the arrival of Antonio Conte as head coach in November. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports The third of those appearances came against Morecambe in the FA Cup earlier this month and saw him jeered by his own supporters when he was substituted. The 25-year-old did not play for the club again following the incident. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Despite his struggles at Spurs, Paris Saint-Germain, Everton and Valencia all tried to sign Ndombele this month. Spurs have also let midfielder Giovani Lo Celso leave on Deadline Day after he secured a loan move to Villarreal. The Argentine, who has struggled for form and fitness during his time at the club, has made 19 appearances in all competitions this season, scoring just once. The 25-year-old joined the north London club on loan in August 2019 from Real Betis, before making the switch permanent in January 2020 for £27m. But he will now return to Spain with Villarreal for a reunion with their head coach Unai Emery, who managed him at Paris Saint-Germain. Tottenham winger Bryan Gil has also departed the club this month after signing for Valencia on loan until the end of the season. The 20-year-old joined last summer from Sevilla, in a swap-plus-cash deal which saw Erik Lamela join the Spanish side with Spurs paying the Andalusian side £21.6m for Gil, according to Sky in Italy. The Spaniard has made 20 appearances in all competitions this season but is yet to start a Premier League game and has not scored a goal. The departures of Ndombele, Lo Celso and Gil paved the way for Spurs to make two signings on Deadline Day after the club completed a double deal for Juventus pair Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur. Winger Kulusevski joins on an 18-month loan deal that costs Spurs £8.3m - £2.5m this season and £5.8m next season - while there is an obligation to buy the Sweden international for £29.2m if certain sporting criteria are met. Meanwhile, midfielder Bentancur joins permanently after signing a four-and-a-half-year deal subject to international clearance and a work permit. The deal for the Uruguay international could cost up to £21.5m with Tottenham paying Juve £15.8m up front, with £5.7m due in potential add-ons. Fabio Paratici, Tottenham's managing director of football, oversaw the signings of both Kulusevski from Atalanta in January 2020 and Bentancur from Boca Juniors in 2017 during his time at Juventus. After completing the deals for Kulusevski and Bentancur, Sky Sports News has been told it is unlikely Spurs will sign any more players before the deadline. There could yet still be one more departure from Spurs on Deadline Day, with Dele Alli set to undergo a medical ahead of a permanent move to Everton that could cost up to £40m. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Everton chairman Bill Kenwright has held talks in his London office with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy about a potential deal for Alli. Initially it was thought any move was a long way from completion, however, it is now understood a breakthrough has been made in negotiations and a medical has been booked in for the player. If Alli does move to Goodison Park, it will be on a two-and-a-half-year contract, with the transfer fee structured around payments based on the midfielder's performances for Everton. While any potential deal for Alli has not yet been formally agreed, it is believed the chances of the transfer taking place are ""looking good"", with new Everton manager Frank Lampard a key factor in convincing the 25-year-old to join.

141,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/12524552/adama-traore-tottenham-hotspur-closing-in-on-signing-wolverhampton-wanderers-winger,Adama Traore: Tottenham Hotspur closing in on signing Wolverhampton Wanderers winger,"Tottenham Hotspur are closing in on a £20m deal for Wolverhampton Wanderers winger Adama Traore. Spurs had a bid of £15m for the Spain international rejected last week, with Wolves understood to value Traore at £25m. However, there is now the expectation a comprise fee can be reached for the 25-year-old winger, who has been with Wolves since 2018, before Monday's transfer deadline. Traore was on the bench for Saturday's 2-1 win over Brentford but came on for the final 15 minutes and saw a goal ruled out by VAR for offside. He has been a long-time target of Spurs, who were in talks to sign Traore at the end of the summer transfer window. That interest has remained despite the change of head coach from ex-Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo to Antonio Conte. Traore is out of contract in June 2023 and a new deal has been on the table for 15 months, with his current club keen to keep hold of him. If Wolves and Spurs are able to agree a fee, it is not expected personal terms would be an issue. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Along with pursuing Traore, Tottenham boss Conte is keen to strengthen his squad further with the addition of a midfielder and a forward before the January window closes. Transfer Centre LIVE! January transfer window: Done deals January transfer window: Club-by-club deals Paper Talk Sky in Italy are reporting Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat is among the midfielders Tottenham are looking at before the deadline. The 25-year-old is a Morocco international but has failed to settle at the Serie A side, having made just 12 appearances in all competitions this season. Meanwhile, a striker could come in the form of teenage Angers forward Mohamed Ali-Cho, who is reported to have been offered to the Premier League side. The 18-year-old, who was at Everton before moving to Angers 18 months ago, is valued at up to £16.8m. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ali-Cho has played five times for France U21s and is reportedly also attracting interest from Bundesliga outfit Borussia Dortmund. Analysis by Jack Wilkinson Before determining whether Adama Traore would improve Tottenham, it's important to establish the role he would play were he to trade Wolverhampton for north London. After all, he's not going to dislodge Harry Kane or Heung-Min Son, Spurs' prolific and trusted attacking duo. With Steven Bergwijn the subject of interest from Ajax, Traore could be brought in as a like-for-like replacement for the Dutchman, he could provide direct competition for Lucas Moura, while there has even been talk that he could be brought to Spurs in a wing-back capacity. Were Traore to move to Spurs, he would undoubtedly upgrade the entertainment factor at the club. Traore's dribbles completed, and dribble success rate are off the scale compared to Bergwijn, and Moura, and he makes almost five times the number of crosses from open play per 90 minutes. But reservations arise over Traore's suitability in perhaps the most-crucial area - end product. In 18 Premier League appearances for Wolves this season, the Spaniard is yet to score or assist, and across his top-flight career in England, he registers a goal or assist at half the rate of Moura and Bergwijn. Could it be the case that Traore's creativity is not fully utilised at Wolves? Could it be truly harnessed by Conte in a strikeforce that features Kane and Son? Those are the questions for Tottenham to consider, and ones that whet the appetite for Spurs fans after a so far barren January. Who will be on the move in January? The January transfer window opens on Saturday January 1, 2022 and closes at 11pm on Monday January 31.

The Netherlands international's wages will be paid in full by the Toffees, who will not have an option to make his move permanent. Crystal Palace and Valencia were also in talks to sign Van de Beek during the January transfer window, but he has opted for a switch to Goodison Park. Palace began negotiations with United after Dennis Bergkamp - the father of Van de Beek's partner - triggered talks. Palace boss Patrick Vieira was pushing for a deal after his former Arsenal team-mate Bergkamp contacted him about Van de Beek, who is in a relationship with the Dutchman's daughter Estelle, with the pair expecting their first child this year. Valencia were also in discussions with United over the 24-year-old, but there were doubts about whether the Spanish side could cover his salary. Van de Beek has struggled to break into the first team at Old Trafford since a £39m move from Ajax in the summer of 2020. Transfer Centre LIVE! Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports Get NOW TV He has been a largely peripheral figure under both current interim manager Ralf Rangnick and former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer despite a goalscoring debut for the club. It is thought Van de Beek felt let down by Solskjaer after he had given him assurances over playing time. But Van de Beek has also struggled to make an impact under Rangnick, having been restricted to just 380 minutes of action this season without starting a Premier League match. He has just two goals and two assists to his name in 50 United appearances. Van de Beek's future will be re-assessed after the season ends, when United will have a new manager in place. Van de Beek had been the talisman of Ajax's exciting young team under Erik ten Hag, which reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2019, scoring six goals in the competition and 28 more in over 100 appearances in the Eredivisie. The midfielder has three-and-a-half years to run on his contract at Old Trafford, although United hold an option to extend the deal by a further year. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Donny van de Beek's arrival at Old Trafford caused no shortage of excitement. Darren Fletcher described him as a ""bargain"" at £39m. Ole Gunnar Solskajer talked up his ""fantastic"" quality. A giddy Rio Ferdinand addressed him as ""Sir Donny"" on Twitter. The 24-year-old had attracted interest from a host of top European clubs while at Ajax, his outstanding performances during their run to the Champions League semi-finals in 2019 marking him out as one of the most exciting young midfielders around. But his move to Manchester United has been a story of frustration and stalled progress. Van de Beek made only four Premier League starts in his first season. This time around, the Netherlands midfielder is yet to make one. Van de Beek's biggest obstacle at Manchester United has been the presence of Bruno Fernandes. Van de Beek played his best football for Ajax in the No 10 position, scoring and creating goals at a formidable rate, but by the time he arrived at Old Trafford in September 2020, Fernandes was firmly established as United's most important player in the position. The Portugal international had made a transformative impact following his arrival from Sporting Lisbon eight months earlier, scoring eight goals and providing seven assists in his first 14 Premier League appearances to help United secure a third-placed finish. He has continued in the same vein ever since. Fernandes has scored more goals (25) and contributed more assists (17) in the Premier League than any other Manchester United player since the start of last season. He has also played the most minutes (4,879). Van de Beek, by contrast, has played just 582 minutes in the same time frame. A player who enjoyed major prominence at Ajax has had to settle for a peripheral role throughout his time at United. There have been occasional flashes of his quality - most recently with his well-taken goal against Watford in November - but his attacking output has not come close to matching Fernandes' on the rare occasions he has been thrown into the side. For many Manchester United supporters, there is frustration more effort has not been made to accommodate Van de Beek elsewhere in the team, but that always looked challenging. There was no obvious role for him in Solskjaer's 4-2-3-1 formation - he is too offensively-minded to play in the midfield two, and not quick or powerful enough to occupy one of the wide positions - and interim manager Ralf Rangnick has now reverted to the same system having unsuccessfully trialled a 4-2-2-2 set-up following his appointment. Solskjaer talked about Van de Beek and Fernandes complementing each other's qualities following the former's arrival at the club back in 2020 but 18 months on neither he nor Rangnick has found room for them both in the same team. Tellingly, they have only started six games together in all competitions since the start of last season. The clock is ticking.

Lampard, who arrived at Everton's Finch Farm training ground on Monday where he was expected to take first-team training for the first time, said: ""It is a huge honour for me to represent and manage a club the size and tradition of Everton Football Club. ""I'm very hungry to get started. After speaking to the owner, chairman and the board, I very much felt their passion and ambition. I hope they felt my ambition and how hard I want to work to bring it together. ""You can feel the passion Everton fans have for their club. That will be hugely important. As a team - the competitive level that the Premier League brings and the position we are in the table - we certainly need that. It's a two-way thing. ""I think Everton is a unique club in that you can really understand what the fans want to see. The first thing they want is fight and desire and that must always be our baseline. ""My first message to the players will be that we have to do this together. We'll try to do our job and I know the fans will be there backing us."" Everton owner Farhad Moshiri said: ""I am really delighted that Frank has joined us. He is an impressive young man on and off the pitch.

Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports this week Latest Everton news ""He impressed us all greatly during the thorough interview process and we're all ready to give him all of our support as he looks to give the team an immediate boost."" Everton chairman Bill Kenwright added: ""Frank impressed us greatly throughout our process, coming across as a modern, ambitious and exciting young manager. He expressed a clear vision on how he wants to take the club forward and, importantly, a tremendous passion and genuine enthusiasm to join us. ""I'm sure Evertonians will give him the special welcome that only they can and will be looking forward to giving him and his coaching staff a warm Goodison welcome next weekend."" Former Swansea and Derby manager Paul Clement will be a first-team coach and Lampard has asked current caretaker manager Duncan Ferguson to also be a part of the backroom staff. As well as Lampard, The Toffees spoke to Vitor Pereira - who exclusively told Sky Sports News on Wednesday that he wanted the job - plus Ferguson.

Lampard had been out of work since being sacked by Chelsea in January 2021 with the club ninth in the Premier League. Prior to his 18-month spell at Chelsea - who he led to an FA Cup final and a top-four finish - Lampard spent a season at Derby, which ended in defeat to Aston Villa in the play-off final.

You can quickly relate to him and there is a positivity and confidence that comes through. The more you see of him, the more you like him. He is a very likeable man and I'm really pleased we've secured his services. ""He is from a footballing family, it is in his blood, he is a winner and played at the highest level of the English game. He will give the team an immediate boost. A dressing room will always rise to someone of his character and achievement. ""I will provide the system to support him. The process is vital to ensure all components of Everton fully support the manager. Fans are the most important part of that. ""You can buy any player; you can't buy the 12th man. The biggest thing for us - for me, for Bill [Kenwright, Chairman], for all parts of this great and beautiful club, is to get behind this manager. ""Let's unite behind the team, give the team the 12th man and start moving up the table. Our future is bright. We just need to be united. Maybe together, me and the fans should be more patient - I am also impatient. ""We have to get behind the manager and give him that Goodison feeling, and I think success will come with that. Throughout the team there are strengths, so if we get the confidence back and the Goodison crowd gives them the 12th man, that is the most important signing we can get in this window.""

Frank Lampard emerged as the stand-out candidate from the recruitment process, and is now tasked with saving the club from relegation. The former Derby and Chelsea boss signs a two-and-a-half-year deal at Goodison Park having seen off Vitor Pereira and Duncan Ferguson in the final round of interviews. Out of management since he was sacked by Chelsea just over a year ago, he must waste no time in getting to work. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Everton are 16th in the Premier League having secured 19 points from 20 matches, with the side starting 2022 with three Premier League defeats. A 2-1 loss to embattled Norwich was the final nail in the coffin of much-maligned manager Benitez and came just days after the club allowed France international Lucas Digne to join Aston Villa. With barely hours now left of the January transfer window, Lampard will have already assessed the playing squad and identified where improvements must be made. It sits atop his in-tray, and the only place he can start as Sky Sports looks at what awaits the new Everton manager. One of Benitez's final acts was to sell Digne having signed Ukraine international Vitalii Mykolenko as his replacement, but the left-back was left out of the matchday squad during the Villa loss. Mykolenko will require a period of adaptation that the international break will hopefully afford him, but Lampard will call upon the more senior members of his squad to take greater responsibility in addressing a leaky defence. Everton appoint Lampard as new manager Get Sky Sports Everton fixtures Premier League table Lampard has spent the past year strengthening the options within his coaching team, and the 43-year-old is determined to convince Anthony Barry to leave Chelsea and join him on Merseyside as part of his backroom staff. Everton have only kept three clean sheets in 20 league games - only Watford and Newcastle have managed fewer. Becoming more defensively organised is essential if the club are to pull away from danger. Despite facing 145 high turnovers themselves, the fifth-fewest of any side, they have conceded the most goals of any side from those instances. Undermining such progress has been their inability to defend set-pieces. Everton have conceded eight goals from corner situations this season, scoring only three times themselves. Only Palace (-7) and Leicester (-6) have a worse differential on corners. For all the improvement during the second period against Villa - where only one of 15 attempts was on target - it was a sign of the current malaise that Ferguson opted to remove senior members of the defence in Seamus Coleman and Michael Keane when victory was paramount. The only way this record can improve is if Lampard identifies his first-choice back-line and has them working tirelessly on creating a better understanding of each other's game. An area of weakness that cropped up regularly to derail Everton's encouraging start under Benitez was their inability to take games to their opponents from the first whistle. Far too often, Benitez was left expressing the same, tired sentiments about individual mistakes leaving the team playing catch-up in the second half. The Toffees have conceded the first goal in each of their last nine Premier League matches, doing so in 15 games overall. Only Norwich and Brentford (16) have conceded the first goal in more games, while only Norwich (3) have scored the first goal in fewer games than Everton (4). Everton have scored just five first-half goals compared to 19 after the break. Indeed, based on games finishing at half-time, they would be bottom of the table on 13 points having led just twice so far this season at the break. Lampard will be aware the side he inherits have been losing at half-time on 11 separate occasions so far this term. The previous highest in a Premier League season was only seven - with 18 games still remaining. Everton have earned just six points in their last 14 league games. Adjusted to three points for a win, their only worse points tally in a run of 14 league games within a single season was in 1950/51, when the side was last relegated from the top division. It is a squad low on confidence, but the sight of a man who has won everything within the domestic game and across Europe will lift the mood. Part of the reason why the team were unable to make strong starts has come down to the absence of key offensive personnel. Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored 16 Premier League goals last season, while he already had three to his name in as many games this term before a series of relapses in his rehabilitation from a quadriceps injury has meant he is yet to return to his best. When speaking as Chelsea boss in December 2020 ahead of facing Everton, Lampard said of the team's talisman: ""What I do respect about Calvert-Lewin is that it feels like a career that he has really worked for. That sounds simple but it is not a straightforward pathway. ""Not everyone gets in their first team at 17 or 18 other than the Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen types of the world. Other players have to find different ways and now he has shown, last season and particularly this season, consistently he's an all-round striker. Every part of his game is a real threat. ""He has quite rightly got into the England team and he has settled into that so he is a major threat for Everton going forward. That's why he has scored so many goals, so fair play to him. It is a good challenge for England to have a few strikers competing and he has thrown himself into that question."" An area Carlo Ancelotti swiftly addressed in his first summer transfer window was the midfield. Allan and Abdoulaye Doucoure were brought in to increase the competition and quality in place of Andre Gomes, Tom Davies and the injury-prone duo Fabian Delph and Jean-Philippe Gbamin. Doucoure and Delph are now expected to be out for another four weeks. Doucoure was forced off against Villa due to a groin problem while Delph sustained a thigh injury during a training session. Davies is also recuperating from a knee injury. It meant that the inexperienced Tyler Onyango was paired with Allan in the second half last weekend, and so Lampard must act quickly to put out the immediate fire of a powderpuff midfield. Benitez had already acknowledged that his team was short of a protective screen in front of his defence, and so the new manager must think smart to plug this vital gap. Benitez admitted that the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules restricted Everton's transfer plans last summer. There is little wriggle room when fringe players are reluctant to leave - and will feel they have another chance under a new manager. Having operated skilfully under a transfer embargo at Chelsea, Lampard is already accustomed to having to think creatively in the market, and must do so again. Everton have been lacking creativity in midfield all season, shown by how the three players who provided the most opportunities during 2020/21 have either been sold or have been unavailable - Digne (46), Gylfi Sigurdsson (44) and James Rodriguez (40). Added to this was the sale of Bernard last summer to UAE club Sharjah FC in order to balance the books, and while Demarai Gray and Andros Townsend - two of Benitez's signings - have ironically been among Everton's better players this campaign, there has been a noticeable shortage of guile in between the lines. Lampard has already acted to fill the creative void. Donny van de Beek wanted to join the club last summer and has agreed to sign on loan until the end of the season from Manchester United. The 24-year-old has struggled to break into the first team at Old Trafford since a £39m move from Ajax in the summer of 2020, but his hunger to succeed matches the profile Everton need. Targeting players with a point to prove on loan was part of Lampard's final interview, and he has already acted on his promise. After being a largely peripheral figure under both current interim Ralf Rangnick and former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Lampard will allow Van de Beek to play in his preferred No 10 position. His new manager was one of the best the Premier League has seen at arriving late in the box, and the Dutchman will see this as the ideal opportunity to kick-start his career in England. An area which is further towards the back of his in-tray, but nonetheless one Lampard will have championed during the interview process. Everton still boasts several exciting prospects. Anthony Gordon has been a shining light in a struggling team, recently scoring his first two senior goals in the 3-2 defeat to Brighton. Still only 20, there is a fearlessness to Gordon but also a composure that belies his emotional connection to the club as an academy product. You can tell he takes defeats personally, and Lampard will relish the opportunity of working with one of the club's brightest talents having developed a reputation for doing so both at Derby and Chelsea, with the likes of Harry Wilson, Mason Mount, Fikayo Tomori, Tammy Abraham, Billy Gilmour and Reece James. Ellis Simms has been allowed to go out on loan to Hearts while Nathan Patterson's arrival from Rangers this month also indicates that in spite of the immediate problems on the pitch, Everton still have one eye on the future. With teenage striker Lewis Dobbin signing a new long-term contract until summer 2026, Jarrad Branthwaite and Onyango also developing, Everton's talent pool still runs deep. The immediate concern will be not to put too much pressure on their shoulders, but coming through such a period of adversity will hopefully stand them all in good stead for the future. Re-connecting with this part of Everton's DNA, Lampard will be tasked with creating a more palatable identity that runs from the first team down through the academy. This is at the heart of the ongoing strategic review and is central to more longer-term thinking. Right now, Everton must find ways of winning matches. Lampard is arriving not as a firefighter, but as someone who clearly believes he is capable of finally being the man around whom Everton can build a healthier environment in which good players can flourish, not regress. The mood among Evertonians is one of fury, fuelled by a need for change. Before last weekend's 1-0 home defeat to Aston Villa, a plane flew over Goodison Park calling for long-standing chairman Bill Kenwright's departure, with the trailing banner reading '22 years of failure, Bill. Time to go'. There was more anger on display after the final whistle as around 150 fans stayed behind to protest, chanting ""Sack the board"", ""Kenwright, get out of our club"" and ""We want our club back"". Frustration has continued to be expressed since then, with a number of supporters congregating outside the Liver Building - where Everton's commercial offices are based - before another protest took place last Wednesday night outside Goodison. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It is far removed from when David Moyes arrived at the club nearly 20 years ago, coining his now iconic ""People's Club"" phrase at his unveiling. Lampard is older now than Moyes was then in March 2002, but recent times have left Everton more disconnected from their people than at any time in the club's history. The new manager is walking into an extremely volatile situation, with fears of a first relegation in 68 years growing, but he can use an emotional fanbase to his advantage. Having the full backing of his supporters, Everton can still be a force against any side in the Premier League at Goodison. Appointing someone who is universally accepted across social media is impossible, and should never be used as a gauge that is wholly true, but by opting against going down the route of Pereira, the club is finally listening to its people again. There is a lot to fix, and forging a strong relationship with the board is an area that must get better. The club's hierarchy are working to bring about a more open connection with the fans, but Lampard's standing in the game can act as a strong conduit between the two. Everton may now have a manager, but they still have no director of football, head of recruitment or scouting chief, with few currently trusting those at the top to make the right decisions and improve things. Owned by Farhad Moshiri since 2016, the Iranian businessman certainly cannot be faulted for his financial backing, having already spent over half-a-billion pounds on transfers since his £200m takeover in 2016. Last week he committed another £100m to Everton after increasing his stake to 94 per cent but he has consistently made poor decisions. Fans have voiced their objections to agent Kia Joorabchian - reportedly advising Moshiri - and Kenwright. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Speaking of a link, former midfielder Tim Cahill is returning in a senior executive role - which provides his contemporary Lampard with a wealth of experience about how the club operated so successfully under Moyes. Cahill was recently chief sports officer at the Aspire Academy in the UAE and on the board at Belgian side KAS Eupen. The return of the 42-year-old, who has also completed his coaching badges, to Goodison is being heralded by supporters given his lofty status gained across eight seasons and 226 league appearances. The new boss must not be undermined by outside influences - especially when it comes to transfer targets. It has been said that Everton have lost their identity during the Moshiri years, but building a relationship with a fans' favourite is a smart move. Lampard is already off to a winning start. Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol: ""Frank Lampard has all the potential to be a great manager of the future. I would think if he does accept the job, if he does become the next Everton manager it will be very exciting, but let's not underestimate he would have a massive job on his hands. ""He would have gone from the relative stability of Chelsea where Chelsea are owned by Roman Abramovich and are run on a day-to-day basis by Marina Granovskaia so that is a very settled structure and he would be going into a situation at Everton where there are different sort of factions in charge of the club. ""The fans are very, very unhappy so he does have a major job on his hands but of course, the first job that he has got is making sure that Everton remain in the Premier League, because speaking to Everton supporters, they are saying look the way this season is going there is a real danger it could end in relegation. ""The other problem Lampard has got if he does become the Everton manager is the transfer window is about to close. It closes on Monday, he hardly has any time to sign any players. ""Everton need reinforcements, especially in midfield. Is he going to have any time or has been told that players are coming in the next 72 hours? So make no mistake, a massive job for Frank Lampard, if, as looks likely, he does become the next Everton manager.""

Barcelona have offered a loan move with a £29m option to make a deal permanent and Traore would like to return to the club where he started his career. Sky Sports News reported earlier this week that Spurs were closing in on a £20m deal for the 26-year-old after their previous bid of £15m was rejected, but Barca now look to have moved ahead of Antonio Conte's side in the race to sign him. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports News also understands that Tottenham will not attempt to convince Traore to turn Barcelona down and will instead focus on other targets. Tottenham are continuing talks over a deal for Porto winger Luis Diaz as they look to strengthen their squad before the transfer deadline. Traore was on the bench for Saturday's 2-1 win over Brentford but came on for the final 15 minutes and saw a goal ruled out by VAR for offside. He has been a long-time target of Spurs, who were in talks to sign Traore at the end of the summer transfer window. That interest has remained despite the change of head coach from ex-Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo to Conte. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports Traore is out of contract in June 2023 and a new deal has been on the table for 15 months, with his current club keen to keep hold of him. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  SSN Chief Reporter Kaveh Solhekol on 'The Transfer Show': ""It looks like Spurs have missed out on Adama Traore, with Barcelona having agreed a deal in principle to take him on loan from Wolves, with an option to buy in the summer for about £25m. ""Spurs have been trying to buy Traore and put in a £15m bid, which was not enough. There was some expectation that a deal could be done for about £20m, but Barcelona have come in for the player, who used to play for the Barcelona Academy. ""And when a club like Barcelona come in for you, it is very difficult to say no and that is why he has decided to go back to Barcelona. And I really do not think here was much Spurs could have done about this. ""There are reports in Spain he has agreed to take a pay cut as well to move to Barcelona - so it looks like bad news for Spurs as far as Traore is concerned."" Analysis by Sky Sports' Adam Bate: Missing out on Adama Traore represents a huge blow for Antonio Conte and Tottenham - this was a deal that was thought to be all but secured with the club keen to add further signings as well. Failure to land the Spain international leaves them with a problem. Traore had been identified to bring impetus at wing-back where Emerson Royal has lacked the creativity to beat a man in the opposition third. While Traore's defending has been questioned, nobody doubts his ball-carrying ability would have added a new dimension. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The talk now is that he never fancied the position. Traore has only been used there in desperation by Bruno Lage - when trailing Brentford and Crystal Palace - and last had a run at wing-back under Nuno Espirito Santo in the autumn of 2019, with mixed results. More likely is that the interest from Barcelona changed his mind. Although Traore has spent the past six-and-a-half years in England, adapting well, Catalonia has always been home. He joined Barca's youth set-up aged eight and made his La Liga debut for the club at 17. The chance to return as an international player in his prime and ready to make an impact under his one-time team-mate Xavi Hernandez is an opportunity that he will have craved. Now he looks set to get that chance. For Tottenham, the search continues. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Spanish football expert Alvaro Montero told Sky Sports: ""This is a deal that appears extremely close. Barcelona have not denied this story and reports here in Spain reflect that there is an agreement between the two clubs and the player. Traore loves the idea of playing again for Barcelona. ""It's extremely surprising due to Barcelona's financial situation. It is only a loan until next summer with the option to buy - but it's not mandatory. We should also remember that Francisco Trincao is also a player of agent Jorge Mendes. ""He's a Barcelona player on loan at Wolves, who have the option to buy the player for €30m. In case Traore plays extremely well and Barcelona want to sign him permanently, maybe Trincao could hold the key to Traore staying beyond July. ""It would be a special move for Traore and a challenge. We have to remember he played for Barcelona B and only twice for the first team seven years ago when he was a boy. He didn't have success in Spain, but thanks to his performances in England, he has been able to get a call-up to the Spanish national team under Luis Enrique. ""He would return to a different Barcelona. When he left, the club was all about ball possession under Pep Guardiola and Enrique, but now you have to remember that while he is not a typical player of Barcelona of the last 10 or 15 years, he's a very physical player who can help Xavi's current team.""

City look on course to win the Premier League title as they hold a nine-point lead over Liverpool, having scored 61 goals in 25 games. However, there were questions at the start of the season as they drew blanks against Leicester, Tottenham, who they face on Saturday Night Football, Southampton and Paris Saint-Germain. Guardiola has confirmed City tried to prise Kane away on multiple occasions, but Spurs were clear in their stance. ""I never was, in my 11 or 12 years, disappointed in what the club cannot do in the transfer market,"" said Guardiola. ""I've never created a fire here because I represent the club and the club is always beyond myself by far. ""We tried [to sign Kane] but it was far away to be done because Tottenham was clear this is not going to happen. And when it happens two, three, four times, it's over. Bentacur: Suarez, Cavani helped secure 'dream' move Why Gundogan can be a top coach LISTEN: Essential Football podcast Premier League table ""Now you can say 'Harry Kane didn't come and everything is going well' but at the time I didn't know it. When we lost to Spurs and Leicester in the Community Shield. And I don't know what will happen in the next few weeks. ""The club gave me players and I'm always delighted - and it's then what we can do together. Maybe if we had a proper striker we would play with a striker but with the players we have we have to adapt."" Without a recognised striker, City have shared the goals around this season, with Riyad Mahrez, Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva all hitting double figures. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""The club is beyond everyone and I know they do the best for me,"" added Guardiola. ""I know them; when we lose we are sad but nobody is pointing fingers saying 'your fault, your fault, your fault.' We don't do that. I don't feel they talk bad about me when we have bad results. That's why I'm happy here. At other clubs when you lose it's 'what's the problem?' ""The important thing is we are there to fight. Try to play better, no matter who plays. We will continue to do it."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Raheem Sterling has been in impressive form recently with a hat-trick against Norwich last weekend and a fine goal in the 5-0 Champions League last-16 first-leg victory at Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday, taking him to 13 goals in all competitions this term. Guardiola has expressed his delight at seeing the England forward ""back to his best"". ""(His confidence) is higher,"" Guardiola said. ""Always the goal is a consequence of his confidence, and the confidence comes with his smile and mood. ""You cannot play well or improve when your mood is down. It's impossible. Good faces - you cannot imagine how important it is. ""When you are all the time complaining, and I am not talking about Raheem because it is not the case and it was not the case, but in general, when someone was here complaining about lack of minutes or whatever, you cannot be better or improve and you are going to perform bad. ""I saw the first half against Sporting, you see the intensity in all his movements, defensively especially, offensively as well...it's magnificent. ""It's what Raheem has done (for) many, many years becoming, in terms of stats in terms of national team, a key player. And for us, for me personally, I am very glad he is back to his best because we need him."" City may look to sign a striker again in the summer transfer window, although they did add to their forward line in January with the signing of Julian Alvarez from River Plate. The 22-year-old signed a five-and-a-half-year contract with City before being loaned back to River until the end of the season. He scored a hat-trick in his first game since signing for City last week. ""The club is always working, it never stops,"" said Guardiola. ""If five players say they want to leave, we have to be ready. Julian scored three goals in the last game for River Plate and Man City made an incredible deal because he is a player who moves really well, the goals he scores are like Jamie Vardy's. We'll see what happens in the future."" City will face Kane for the first time since missing out on him last summer as he did not play in Spurs' 1-0 win earlier in the season. New Tottenham midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur has revealed that Antonio Conte played a key role in his January arrival. Betancur was a £21.5m Deadline Day transfer from Juventus, joining along with team-mate Dejan Kulusevski. ""The fact that [head coach] Antonio Conte was here was a massive factor in helping me make up my decision to join Tottenham, and a big motivation,"" Bentacur told Sky Sports. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I feel that he can dramatically improve me as a player and I'm looking forward to learning from him big time.

Arsenal took a first-half lead when Bukayo Saka scored his fourth goal in three Premier League games, but they could have been in front earlier had they been awarded a penalty after 10 minutes. City keeper Ederson appeared to foul Martin Odegaard, but having been checked by VAR, it was decided Edersen had touched the ball and no penalty was given. The Gunners remained in control of the match until an incredible five minutes of action after half-time. Bernardo Silva went down in the penalty area under a challenge from Granit Xhaka that was originally waved away by Stuart Attwell but he overturned his decision on the advice of VAR which led to Riyad Mahrez equalising from the spot. Just 90 seconds later, Nathan Ake made a heroic and unlikely clearance off the line and Gabriel Martinelli somehow failed to score from the rebound. Then the game took another turn when Gabriel Magalhaes picked up a second booking for disrupting a Manchester City counter-attack. It left Pep Guardiola's men with 34 minutes to break down the Arsenal 10-men but a goal didn't look likely until the clock ticked past 90 minutes and Rodri forced home a late winner. Premier League table How the teams lined up Match stats Get Sky Sports for your home His celebrations in front of the Arsenal end triggered some ugly scenes as bottles were thrown onto the pitch. The result means City have won 11 games on the spin in the Premier League and puts them 11 points clear of Chelsea, who play Liverpool on Super Sunday. Arsenal: Ramsdale (7), Tomiyasu (7), White (8), Gabriel (7), Tierney (8), Partey (7), Xhaka (7), Saka (9), Odegaard (7), Martinelli (8), Lacazette (7)   Subs used: Smith Rowe (7), Holding (6), Elneny (6)   Man City: Ederson (7), Cancelo (7), Dias (7), Laporte (7), Ake (7), Rodri (8), De Bruyne (6), Bernardo Silva (7), Mahrez (6), Jesus (6), Sterling (6)   Subs used: Gundogan (6)   Man of the match: Bukakyo Saka Both these teams came into the contest with expert records defensively in first halves. Since the Aaron Ramsdale, Ben White and Gabriel axis was formed 16 games ago, Arsenal have not conceded a goal before the 38th minute while Man City had conceded just one first-half goal all season. Those records did not look overly in danger of being added to in a very watchable half but one did not offer much goalmouth action. Ruben Dias had City's best moment, flicking a Raheem Sterling cross wide of the post with Ramsdale flapping mid-air whilst Kevin De Bruyne whipped a ferocious effort just past the post on 19 minutes. In between those chances, Odegaard had what looked a good shout for a penalty when Ederson came racing out to make a tackle at his feet but VAR deemed from the 10 replays shown that he just about got enough of the ball. Arsenal were standing strong and started to work their attacking transitions to greater effect as the half wore on. It led to the opening goal on 31 minutes. Kieran Tierney worked himself into space down the left and sent over an intelligent low cross that was met with a swipe of Saka's left foot that took the ball straight into the corner. It was another example of the game-changing quality the 20-year-old youngster possesses. Gabriel Martinelli then teased Joao Cancelo down his flank and poked an effort across Ederson that was inches away from giving the Gunners a two-goal cushion at the break. There was no immediate reaction from City after the break as Arsenal looked well drilled in their shape. Then the game changed on 53 minutes when Silva danced around Xhaka and into the penalty area. There was a coming-together and a slight pull on the shirt of Silva but initially, Atwell waved it away before being asked to review the incident on the pitchside monitor, where he reversed his decision and awarded the penalty. Tempers flared in the aftermath as the incident was shown on the big screen and Gabriel picked up a yellow card. Mahrez stroked home the penalty to give City a route back into the match without playing particularly well. It was almost 2-1 to Arsenal moments later but Ake made a miraculous clearance off his goal-line after Aymeric Laporte had headed one over Ederson. How Martinelli missed the rebound from five yards out with the goal gaping will be talked about for years to come at The Emirates. That wasn't the end of the mid-half drama as Gabriel was given his marching orders when stopping a City counter in midfield to pick up his second yellow card within 90 seconds. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It was expected that City would lay siege to the Arsenal 10 men in the final quarter but with Xhaka dropping back to centre-back, Arsenal defended their box brilliantly. City failed to trouble Ramsdale with any shots of intent - until the 91st minute when they nicked the game in dramatic fashion. A ball into the box bobbled into the path of Rodri, who got a toe to the ball to force it past Ramsdale and into the corner. He roared away in celebration towards the Arsenal fans, who responded by throwing multiple bottles in the direction of the City players in an ugly finish to the game. City left it late, but that's what champions do. Sky Sports' Lewis Jones writes: Arsenal had just been beaten by Manchester City - nothing new there, of course. But it was different this time. The home fans stayed and cheered their team with great gusto, in full appreciation that Mikel Arteta's team were absolutely superb against the champions-in-waiting. The better side for 85 minutes of the match, in fact. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The problems came in the other five minutes midway through the half. I'm not sure I've been at a match where the game has changed so much in such a short space of time. Unfortunately for Arsenal, it was much of their own doing. Granit Xhaka's lazy challenge and shirt pull on Bernardo Silva gave the referee a decision to make. Gabriel Martinelli - full of energy and quality - snatched at what was an open goal chance after Nathan Ake's miraculous clearance off the line. And then Gabriel Magalhaes' moment of inexperience blotted his copybook when picking up his second yellow card for a needless foul. Those three incidents defined the result. Elite teams like Man City feast upon such mistakes and although Arsenal were superb in every department, the big moments in the match were gobbled up by the City machine. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""At the end, it's very frustrating but Mikel was very proud of the performance and at the same time, frustrated,"" said Arsenal coach Albert Stuivenberg, who was standing in for the absent Arteta. Frustration was the perfect word to sum up the feeling in the ground at full-time. But when the dust settles, those Arsenal fans can look back on a performance that gives the club so much hope and excitement for the future. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Arsenal coach Albert Stuivenberg said: ""Very frustrated, of course, with the end result. But also very proud of the performance of the players. ""When you end the game playing with 10 players against this City team and don't concede a lot of chances, the overall performance has been very good. What about the penalties? ""Confusing is the right word. We are looking for consistency there. For me the Odegaard moment is a clear penalty but if there's any consistency there you'd say, bring the referee over to check. That didn't happen. And with the City penalty it happens and I thought it was quite soft. But OK, it happened. ""We took the game again after that because we had the opportunity directly to score with Martinelli but it all changed with the red card."" Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said: ""They were better. We faced a team that in the last years struggled to be in the top four and they started the season being in the bottom. And now they're in the four. They had six, seven days after their last game against Norwich… we had two days and a half and Brentford was so tough. And we didn't have energy. ""We tried to put one more player in the middle to have more control, and more passes because we know the transitions with Saka, Martinelli, Lacazette, the physicality they have should be difficult and was difficult because we didn't have anything. ""We tried and tried and in the second half, one minute changed it. The penalty and after the action for the own goal and the sending-off... people will try to analyse many things, but the coin sometimes falls down on your side, sometimes the other side.

Arsenal became willing to allow the 32-year-old to leave after stripping him of the captaincy in December following a disciplinary issue. The 32-year-old did not play for the club after December 6, and was left out of their squad for their warm-weather training camp in Dubai. Aubameyang, who scored 92 goals in 163 games for the Gunners, leaves the Emirates Stadium inside the final 18 months of a contract worth £350,000 a week. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The Premier League club are estimated to be making a saving of around £25m in wages with Aubameyang's departure. But his exit means Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta's will finish the season with just two recognised strikers in his squad, with both Eddie Nketiah and Alex Lacazette out of contract in the summer. The deal had looked off earlier on Deadline Day after talks broke down over the financial part of the deal. But it is understood that Aubameyang, who flew out to Barcelona on Monday morning, took a significant pay cut to facilitate the move. Transfer Centre LIVE! Papers - latest headlines Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol: ""This is a big risk by Mikel Arteta because what happens if Aubameyang goes to Barcelona and scores a lot of goals? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It just shows how much Arsenal are backing the judgement of their manager. Arteta is saying 'I know he is our best goalscorer, he is the club captain, he is the highest earner at the club for disciplinary reasons l don't want him at the club'. It's a big, big call. ""I know he is leaving Arsenal under a bit of a cloud but there are also a lot of good memories. His ratio of goals to games is right up there with the great players. ""Arsenal supporters will say 'we are weaker now than we were at the start of the window'. But in this instance, you have to back Mikel Arteta's judgement - that is what the Arsenal owners are doing."" Sky Sports' Adam Bate: ""The drop in performance levels has been so great that it is probably worth reminding people that Aubameyang was a world-class striker for much of his time at Arsenal. ""Indeed, from the day of his debut for the club in February 2018 until the day of his double against Everton in February 2020, no player scored more Premier League goals. He scored 49 times in that period, the same as Mohamed Salah and a dozen more than Harry Kane. ""There was a notable highlight after that when he scored twice in Arsenal's FA Cup final win over Chelsea in the summer of 2020. But almost as soon as his new contract was signed that September, there has been a sense of decline, of a player whose best days are behind him. ""Stripped of the captaincy, too often the leadership has had to come from elsewhere. It is the young players driving Arsenal on under Mikel Arteta, not their best-paid player. That is a situation the club knows well having been through similar with Mesut Ozil. It cannot last. ""At 32, there will be hope that Aubameyang could yet recapture his best form, inspired by new surroundings and the challenge of restoring Barcelona to their former glories. At Arsenal, any regret will be tempered by the feeling that it is time for the club to move on."" Paul Merson told Sky Sports: Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""If Alexandre Lacazette puts the open goal chance away against Burnley, it is job done and no one is moaning at all. ""Everyone would be talking about how good a result that would have been for Arsenal with a clean sheet too. It's 1-0 to the Arsenal and everything is great. But he misses an open goal and all of a sudden, they have only scored one goal in January, which came in their best performance by a mile. ""That's the problem Arsenal have. You are not going to win too much without a centre forward. ""I know people will say Manchester City do, but they still have to win the Champions League playing with a false nine.

We take a look at the problems which undermined his position... Three years. No trophies. Despite all the humiliating defeats in his final weeks in charge, that will be the damning review of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's time in charge of Manchester United. Jose Mourinho won three. Louis van Gaal picked up the FA Cup. There was at least a Community Shield for David Moyes. But without silverware, Solskjaer's argument of gradual progression under his stewardship was hard to justify. There was no milestone moment and nothing for United supporters to celebrate. How things might have worked out differently had that long, long penalty shootout against Villarreal in last season's Europa League final gone in their favour. It may not be the most prestigious trophy but it would have been a boost to belief for Solskjaer's squad, capped a season in which they finished second in the table, and encouraged supporters that he had them on the right lines. It was cruel that a missed penalty by David de Gea of all people would decide that one. But failing to get over the line in the big moments became a recurring theme of his tenure. There were three semi-finals in 2019/20 - and in each one United didn't perform. Comprehensive defeats to Chelsea in the FA Cup and Manchester City in the first leg of their Carabao Cup tie did for them domestically, while a 1-0 lead was thrown away against Sevilla in the Europa League. There was another semi-final loss last season, too. The Carabao Cup's traditional two-leg semi-finals were reduced to one and United were handed home advantage but still, Man City won 2-0 on another disappointing night for the hosts at Old Trafford. Man Utd fixtures Premier League table Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments If the penalty shootout defeat to Villarreal was unlucky, those four semi-finals point to a more damning picture of a side unable to deliver when the pressure was on. It was a recurring problem which highlighted wider issues. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Until the recent defeat to Manchester City, Solskjaer could boast to be Pep Guardiola's only regular opponent with a winning record over him. United have won on their last three trips to the Etihad and other standout results, such as the two wins at Paris Saint-Germain, will be proud moments - times when Solskjaer has quietened critics of his pedigree. But the derby defeat and the 5-0 thrashing by Liverpool before that at Old Trafford fuelled the narrative that Solskjaer didn't have the tactical and managerial acumen required to take United to the very top. The two most recent Premier League winning managers, Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp, will go down among the greats. That's the level Solskjaer is competing with. Meanwhile, Thomas Tuchel's transformative impact in west London has confirmed the Chelsea manager's quality, too. The immediate improvement he made after replacing Frank Lampard - a club legend perceived to have got the job without the required managerial experience - was an unhelpful point of comparison for Solskjaer. Appointed initially as a caretaker, Solskjaer's history of only previously coaching Molde and Cardiff was always going to be held against him when he faltered. As results and performances dipped, debate grew about the coaching of United's build-up play, balance in midfield, defensive structure, and attacking patterns. Pundits picked apart the litter of small errors which in each match would cost United time and again. The defensive mistakes. The vulnerability at set-pieces. The positional errors in defensive midfield. The pressing plans. But in an era when managerial philosophies matter, Solskjaer never had a clear overall style. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  His best victories came on the counter-attack, when United accepted their limitations - whether that be weaknesses in certain areas of the pitch or a lack of coaching of complex tactics in and out of possession. But that approach jarred with Solskajer's desire to replicate the front-foot attitude of United's great teams of the past - and some of his worst defeats came when they tried to be protagonists. In a league where Guardiola, Klopp and Tuchel set the standard for shaping a team, Solskjaer too often needed moments of brilliance from individual members of United's expensively assembled cast. It worked at times but it was never going to be a consistent formula for success. With nine goals in 12 games, Cristiano Ronaldo is something of an odd scapegoat for United's struggles this season. He has scored in each of their four Champions League games, with late goals against Villarreal and Atalanta (twice) so far proving vital and accounting for five of their seven points. In the Premier League, he hasn't been quite as lethal but showed recently at Tottenham how effective he remains at the age of 36. But with United disjointed and uncoordinated out of possession, Ronaldo's pressing - or lack of - has been a focus. So has the knock-on impact of who Solskjaer should select around him and the style changes required to adapt to his strengths and weaknesses. Would United be better off without him? The argument goes that his arrival has diverted this group off the path of progress they were on and the gains from his goals are outweighed by the impact on their overall play. But that certainly wasn't the mood in the summer, when they sealed a last-gasp deal to bring one of the greatest players of all time back to Old Trafford and it isn't a flattering reflection on Solskjaer if he was unable to find the tactical solutions to make the most of a player of Ronaldo's calibre. However, perhaps the major issue for Solskjaer when it comes to Ronaldo is the way his return raised expectations. He was seen as a game-changer; the superstar player who would deliver the goals to lift United into serious title contention. With Ronaldo recruited, the time was now and the talk of steady progress and building towards something in seasons to come had to be shelved. Ronaldo is a winner - that's no secret - and any time United's standards dropped, the camera focused on his frustrated figure. He didn't return to be outclassed by Liverpool and Man City or embarrassed at Watford. It was a signing which ramped up the pressure. It enhanced the spotlight on Solskjaer's work and illuminated his shortcomings. The Champions League returns, with  the £250,000 Super 6 jackpot up for grabs. Play for free, entries by 7:45.

Rangnick has arrived at Old Trafford to take charge until the end of the season, and will then take up a consultancy role as the club seek a permanent successor to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The 63-year-old former Schalke, Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig boss has developed a reputation as one of the game's most influential coaches, helping to revolutionise German football with a focus on Gegenpressing tactics. Carragher has welcomed the German's arrival - but insists one task must be top of the agenda.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""The top teams in European football, and three of them are in the Premier League, all play the way Rangnick has always wanted his teams to play going back 20 years. ""Top-level football is played like that and Manchester United were a million miles away from that. Rangnick has the tools at Man Utd Man Utd fixtures Premier League table Get Sky Sports ""Rangnick is coming in now to make sure that Manchester United get back into the Champions League for next season. ""But Rangnick's biggest job is identifying the next coach. The top people at the club will be taking advice from him. He will want the next coach to be in his image so he'll be almost getting them ready for the next coach and how they want to play."" Carragher warned, though, that Rangnick's trademark high-press approach - a ""heavy metal"" style he has admitted to sharing with Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp - could take time to implement. ""Yes, Manchester United need [Rangnick] in terms of that there's a clear idea of what he wants to do. ""When you watched Manchester United in the last few weeks when things weren't going well, you weren't sure what they were trying to do. Especially against Liverpool [a 5-0 home defeat in October]; were they trying to press or were they trying to drop off? ""There's no exact science to win a football game - there are different ways - but Manchester United have not had a clear plan and this guy has a plan. ""The problem is that his plan could be chalk and cheese with Manchester United at the moment; there are five or six players you think won't fit into that way of playing. ""His way of playing has to be coached and trained on; it's not something you work on in a week. You need to learn to train for the physical output too; that can cause injuries and that may make it difficult for Manchester United to get into the top four."" ""We have five different situations in football that decide football games: What happens if we have the ball ourselves? How do we play against defensive teams, against teams that attack high or try to press? ""Number two is what do we want to do if the other team has got the ball? Our idea is simple - very similar to my coaching friend Klopp - our football is heavy metal, rock and roll, not slow waltz; we hate square passes, back passes. ""Then we have the two situations of transition - what happens when we lose the ball and what happens when we win the ball?""Then the set-pieces, which are highly important. All the top teams in all these five areas are above average, if not top."" Fellow Sky Sports pundit Roy Keane criticised Manchester United's recent recruitment off the pitch and hopes Rangnick can focus on the team ""I don't have a problem with it,"" Keane said of Rangnick's appointment. ""The big decision is getting the right manager in [after Rangnick] and getting players like Fernandes and Ronaldo to start running. ""Man Utd have talented players in possession but the game is also about out of possession. They have the talent but it needs coaching. ""We hope [that the Rangnick appointment is a breakthrough], we hope so. The proof will be in the pudding over the next few years when we see who comes into the club, and that it's not because you know somebody or have a certain agent. ""You hope whoever does come into the club starts to make the right decisions, get the right people in for the job, and not because someone might know somebody, or they are a decent guy.

""It will be much different [to under Solskjaer]. The demands on individuals in terms of what their roles are at any given time in a match, depending on where the ball is and so on, with Solskjaer you did feel it was kind of making it up as they went along. ""They have so much individual talent that Solskajer left them to it or hoped that talent would win the day. He obviously worked hard on the training ground but what he was working on wasn't working and he wasn't able to compete with the modern elite coaches. ""We'll see what Rangnick wants pretty quickly.

""The bit that's sometimes misunderstood is that when he was at the height of his coaching power in 2011 - he'd just taken Schalke to the Champions League semi-final, just won the cup, three months into the next season, he resigned citing burnout. ""At that point, he took a sidestep - a club building job more than a coaching job - if he hadn't I think he would have a very different CV. ""Why has he not taken on big jobs in Germany like Bayern or the national team? When he came through in the late '90s, guys like him wouldn't get good jobs because he wasn't a former player and he wasn't a big name.

It was February 1983 and, aged 25, he was serving as player-manager of Viktoria Backnang, a small-town team in Germany's sixth tier, when Valeriy Lobanovskiy's Dynamo Kiev turned up for a mid-season friendly. Lobanovskiy's side were regarded as the strongest in the Soviet Union and it was no surprise they easily swatted their amateur opponents aside. But the manner in which they did it made a lasting impression on Rangnick, a bewildered figure in central midfield. ""A few minutes in, when the ball had gone out for a throw, I had to stop and count the opposition players,"" he recalls in Raphael Honigstein's book, Das Reboot. ""That was the first time I felt what it was like to come up against a team who systematically pressed the ball. ""I had played against big professional teams before - and of course we lost those games as well - but they at least gave you a bit of breathing space, the chance to 'put a foot on the ball', as we used to say."" Lobanovskiy's side afforded Rangnick and his team-mates no such luxury. ""I felt constantly under pressure for the entire ninety minutes,"" he added. ""It was the first time I sensed: this is football of a very different kind."" Dynamo Kiev returned to the town for training camps each season under Lobanovskiy, and Rangnick, who was studying for his coaching badges at the time, attended every session, pen and notepad in hand, to study the way they played and how they did it. Man Utd appoint Rangnick as interim manager Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports Lobanovskiy's relentless, organised pressing tactics would form the basis of Rangnick's own philosophy, one he would later implement at a string of clubs including Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig, helping to revolutionise German football, inspire a generation of coaches including Jurgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel, and, ultimately, take him to the Manchester United hotseat. Back in the 80s, however, his ideas were deemed radical. Bundesliga sides at the time were a reflection of the country's hugely successful national team. ""They lined up with a sweeper, and man-marking was the preferred system,"" says Rangnick in Das Reboot. There was little room for manoeuvre and little desire for it either. But Rangnick felt German football was in danger of getting left behind. He studied Arrigo Sacchi's AC Milan as well as Lobanovskiy's Dynamo Kiev, observing the potential of a zonal marking system, coupled with high-intensity pressing. Sacchi's Milan, winners of back-to-back European Cups in 1989 and 1990, showed the power of collective brilliance over a reliance on individuals. Rangnick was also inspired by the fact Sacchi, like him, was not a distinguished former player. A meeting with Zdenek Zeman, a Czech coach with a similar profile who was implementing similar tactics at Foggia, also in Italy, served as further inspiration. Zeman emphasised to Rangnick that his players needed to be the fittest in the division in order to make the approach work. ""I realised that a bit of pressing isn't enough,"" said Rangnick. ""It is a bit like being a bit pregnant - it's nothing."" Rangnick began to apply those learnings while in charge of numerous lower-league clubs, enjoying notable success during a spell at Ulm 1846, whom he guided to the Bundesliga in 1999 with a hungry, energetic side which included a young Tuchel - at least before he was forced to retire with a knee injury aged 24. All the while, Germany's quarter-final exit to Croatia at the 1998 World Cup had prompted introspection in the country. Were Rangnick's concerns about German football, with its devotion to the outdated sweeper system, in fact well founded? It certainly seemed that way but the resistance to change continued, fuelled by a high-profile television appearance from Rangnick in December 1998 in which he was asked to explain his tactics. The bespectacled coach was widely disparaged as a ""professor"". Rangnick, though, kept going. He was handed the manager's job at Stuttgart on the back of his achievements with Ulm but having guided them to an eighth-placed Bundesliga finish in his first season, he was sacked with them in the relegation zone in his second. He won promotion back to the Bundesliga with Hannover after that, coming up against a Mainz side managed by Klopp, who had played under Wolfgang Frank, another early advocate of zonal marking and pressing tactics, before his own move into management, but a subsequent spell in charge of Schalke proved less successful. Rangnick's time there damaged his reputation further in the eyes of his critics and prompted him to pursue a job where he would have more control, and more freedom to implement his ideas. It led him to Hoffenheim, a third-tier club with no notable history but a wealthy and ambitious owner in software mogul Dietmar Hopp, who wanted to harness Rangnick's methods in order to transform the club into a force of German football. Rangnick embraced the challenge, describing Hoffenheim as a ""blank sheet of paper"". He was able to put his ideas into practice on the pitch and also given control over recruitment, insisting they only sign players aged 23 or under, the idea being that, as well as retaining resale value, they would be more receptive to new ideas and be physically capable of meeting the off-the-ball demands of his counter-pressing tactics. Hoffenheim were derided as a ""test-tube club"" by some but their rise to prominence was rapid under Rangnick. Back-to-back promotions led them to the top-flight two years after Rangnick's appointment in 2006. They duly took the Bundesliga by storm. ""That's the kind of football we want to play one day,"" said Klopp after his Borussia Dortmund side were dismantled by Rangnick's Hoffenheim in September 2008, losing 4-1. Joachim Low, Germany's national team coach at the time, described their 2-1 loss to Bayern Munich a few months later as ""perhaps the fastest Bundesliga match ever"". Hoffenheim went on to finish that season in seventh place and, by that point, German football was finally embracing Rangnick's way of playing. His time in charge of Hoffenheim was followed by a second spell at Schalke, during which he won the German Cup, the first major trophy of his career, and guided the club to a Champions League semi-final, where they were defeated, perhaps fatefully, by Manchester United. But arguably his best work to date came subsequently at RB Leipzig, where Rangnick had an impact similar to the one he had at Hoffenheim. In the first of two spells as head coach, in 2015/16, he won them promotion to the Bundesliga while also fulfilling director of football duties for Red Bull's network of clubs. In the second, in 2018/19, he guided them to a third-placed finish, helping to establish their presence in the Champions League. By then, over in Bavaria, Pep Guardiola's spell in charge of Bayern Munich had accelerated the development of coordinated gegenpressing tactics in German football. Rangnick and his contemporaries, once viewed as a ""fringe movement of modernists"", as Honigstein puts it in Das Reboot, had finally become mainstream. ""Rangnick may never have won the championship,"" added Honigstein, ""but he has won the argument.""

Michael Carrick is currently coaching the team following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's sacking last Sunday but Rangnick is set to be appointed as interim manager. The plan would then be for him to move into a consultancy role at the end of the season, when United intend to bring in a long-term boss. However, despite Rangnick's highly respected reputation in the game as an intensive coach who has overseen the rise of clubs such as Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig through the German leagues, Sky Sports pundit Merson believes the challenge at United is different to anything he's faced before and won't be easy. ""Why do they need an interim manager? Because they don't know what they're doing at the moment, in my opinion,"" Merson told Soccer Saturday. ""Ole would have been at the club still today if it wasn't for two goals in the last minute at Watford. I don't think there was any plan. They didn't think in their wildest dreams it was going to end up like that at Watford. At 2-1, I think he's still in charge come Sunday. I think they were going to keep it going as long as they could. ""Now, to bring in a manager… I'm hearing people going how great he is - but he's never managed in England, he's never managed one of the top teams in the world. Why is that? Why has no one else come in for him when managers have been up? ""I hear great things about him, people saying he's going to press and he's hard working and he's turned lesser teams into real contenders.

""What I'm hearing is it's like a gimme, he'll come in and that will be it. That Man Utd are lucky. I'm not sure about that."" Merson added that the recent performances of the United players during defeats to Manchester City, Liverpool and Watford would make coaching them a tough job for any manager. ""Man City was embarrassing,"" he said. ""Liverpool was bad but it wasn't as bad as Man City, and then Watford was an absolute joke.

""You could have Pep Guardiola on the bench sitting next to Jurgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel but, if the players aren't running around, it doesn't matter what you're doing on the bench."" Mauricio Pochettino is favourite to be handed the reins at United next summer but Merson is also uncertain about how that appointment could play out. Former Tottenham boss Pochettino is currently in charge of Paris St-Germain and contracted with the French club until 2023, but Merson says the performances of PSG this season - good or bad - could complicate matters. ""If Pochettino doesn't win the Champions League with PSG, Man Utd fans are going to be asking that question: why do we want Pochettino? He's got a squad of players at PSG who are some of the best in the world and you haven't won the Champions League?

Ralf Rangnick has not taken charge yet - his first game as interim manager is likely to be Thursday's meeting with Arsenal - but the way in which Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Bruno Fernandes sprinted towards the blue-shirted defenders in possession showed his influence may already have taken hold. Cristiano Ronaldo's omission from the starting line-up felt significant too. The 36-year-old remains a devastating goalscorer but he is not a natural fit for the aggressive, high-pressing approach Rangnick is known for and he was sacrificed here, forced to make do with a place on the bench in a league game for only the fourth time in nine seasons. Some might argue Manchester United's attacking threat was blunted without him. They only managed three shots on goal to Chelsea's 24, after all. But the explanation for his absence lay in the industrious off-the-ball work of the attacking players selected. Sancho and Rashford, normally stationed either side of Ronaldo, instead operated as a front two, with Fernandes in support. From there, they were able to apply pressure in central areas and disrupt Chelsea's build-up play. ""Blocking the middle of the pitch was a big part of it for us,"" admitted Michael Carrick afterwards. It was telling that, despite being withdrawn on 64 and 77 minutes respectively, Sancho and Rashford finished the game having recorded more sprints - 17 by Sancho and 19 by Rashford - than anyone else.

Their total of six was their second-highest in any game all season. Carrick insisted afterwards that Rangnick had no input on the side's approach at Stamford Bridge. The caretaker manager also pointed out this was not the first time United have adopted high-pressing tactics this season. But there was certainly a different feel to it.

Fernandes was clearing the danger rather than searching for a team-mate when he launched the ball upfield following a Chelsea set-piece but Rashford and Sancho charged forward immediately, putting Jorginho under pressure as he attempted to deal with the high ball. The Chelsea man was clearly affected by the red shirts bearing down on him, his panicked first touch allowing Sancho to sprint through on goal and beat Edouard Mendy. From one end of the pitch to the other in a matter of seconds. It was a very Rangnick goal. ""The real thing that stands out about it is the pressure being put on Jorginho,"" said Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher on co-commentary. There was a certain symbolism, too, to the fact that Sancho was the man to score it. The 21-year-old has endured a difficult start to life at Old Trafford following his £73m move from Borussia Dortmund, but he has now scored two goals in the last two games and could benefit from Rangnick's arrival more than anyone. Sancho, of course, is already accustomed to the tactical intricacies of a high-pressing system having spent four immensely successful seasons with Borussia Dortmund. That experience will serve him well under a manager who has long admired him. Rangnick told Sky Sports News last season that he scouted the youngster for four years while at RB Leipzig. ""He's one of the best wing-offensive players in Europe,"" he said. This performance showed why Rangnick may be inclined to build his side around Sancho rather than Ronaldo but he and Rashford were not the only ones to press their opponents high up the pitch. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Fred, given more licence to roam forward thanks to the presence of Scott McTominay and Nemanja Matic behind him, also showed a willingness to chase down Chelsea players high up the pitch and should have won it for the visitors when he intercepted Mendy's pass in stoppage time, only to direct a weak shot straight into the goalkeeper's arms. Fred's spirited performance typified that of the team as a whole. They were, of course, fortunate that Chelsea were not more clinical in front of goal but there was no shortage of fight and desire. Indeed, after their hapless showings in the final months of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's reign, the level of defensive dedication was a welcome sight. Manchester United recorded their highest totals for both tackles (21) and blocks (eight) all season. Rangnick will aim to harness those combative qualities in the months ahead while also honing the high-pressing potential the side demonstrated at Stamford Bridge. Ronaldo may provide a stern test of his man-management skills but he will have watched this game believing there are tools in place for him to work with.

The figures come at a time when the club have lacked sparkle on the field, slipping to sixth in the Premier League after resounding losses to rivals Liverpool and Manchester City in recent weeks. Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is under increasing pressure to turn the on-field situation around, with the club currently nine points behind leaders Chelsea. Woodward, who is due to be leaving his role at the end of the year, said: ""While these financial results today demonstrate our resilience through the pandemic, our top priority is success on the pitch. ""The manager, players and everyone at the club are determined to achieve that objective."" United's wage bill rose by 23 per cent during the period in which they signed Cristiano Ronaldo. Figures for the first quarter of the 2021-22 financial year show a rise of £16.6m in ""employee benefit expenses"" compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week Watch Premier League highlights The total amount spent on salaries during the quarter ended September 30, when the club re-signed Ronaldo and also brought in Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho, was £88.5m. This rise was offset by £17.4m brought in through player sales, principally Dan James' move to Leeds, although the club did also earn a sell-on fee from Romelu Lukaku's transfer from Inter Milan to Chelsea. Overall, total revenue increased by 16.1 per cent to £126.5m, explained largely by the obvious increase in matchday income that came with the return of fans to games after coronavirus restrictions were lifted. Matchday revenue was £18.8m compared to just £1.7m the previous year, when games were played behind closed doors. This rise helped operating losses decrease from £27.1m to £10.2m compared to 2020-21. Commercial revenues rose by 7.9 per cent to £64.4m. This will partially have been driven by the arrival of Ronaldo, although the Portuguese was only back at the club for the final month of the quarter. The club's net debt stood at £439.7m on September 30, down slightly from £440.6m the previous year. ",positive,liverpool,1

No meetings have taken place as yet with the interim manager regarding the design of his future position, which comes into effect on June 1. United's hierarchy took the decision to put strategic planning on hold to allow Rangnick full focus on trying to salvage the season through coaching. As such, even the basics of the agreement, like where the German would be based, have not materialised. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Richard Arnold, United's chief executive officer who has been described as a contrast to Ed Woodward as he is more collaborative and grants greater responsibility to staff, was ""incredibly open"" to the idea of recruiting Rangnick in a dual-purpose capacity. It is understood Arnold is invested in widening the brains trust at the club and is keen to have Rangnick's ""knowledge on tap"" until 2024. But his core expertise - structurally overhauling a club and implementing sustainable, successful methodology - has so far gone unused. Man Utd fixtures Premier League table Get Sky Sports How to watch Premier League highlights That is on account of the state of play when he was appointed - the team had lost five out of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's last seven fixtures - as well as a lack of time due to a stacked schedule. United's Champions League exit allows more time for some forward planning, but the notion Rangnick could operate as a loose version of a sporting director, helping John Murtough and Darren Fletcher knit a solid strategy behind the scenes, has been labelled ""hugely unlikely."" Sources have intimated his role in all probability will be centered around sharing insights on innovation, scouting and linking the club with bright football minds rather than fundamentally altering their set-up. It was highlighted that ""consultancy,"" in its essence, suggests separation and independence. United are set to lean on Rangnick's in-depth knowledge of the squad and what is required to build a strong collective for a progressive on-pitch identity. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The 63-year-old's temporary tenure has been coloured by some unsavoury leaks despite him significantly improving the team's underlying metrics. United have a ""pretty good idea where the briefings are coming from"" and are keen to erase a self-serving culture. There is an appreciation that Rangnick has not offered any counter-leaks, opting for honesty during his media commitments instead. The analysis the interim manager provides on the squad will stretch well beyond the tactical and technical to drill down into how United can improve recruitment not only in a stylistic sense, but character-wise too. However, reports he is heavily involved in the decision-making process over the club's permanent manager are incorrect. Rangnick has done what has been asked of him, which is to concentrate on coaching. United have distanced themselves from coverage suggesting they are circling around Thomas Tuchel amid Chelsea's uncertain future, with one source describing it as ""media talk not reality."" They maintain there is a four-man shortlist being considered to take charge of the club, which does not feature the reigning European Cup-winning manager. United are aware that the opening move for a new ownership group at Stamford Bridge will be to secure Tuchel's future. The 48-year-old has also displayed the absolute opposite of a desire to exit Chelsea, navigating difficult circumstances with aplomb and underlining his happiness despite the upheaval. Mauricio Pochettino, Erik ten Hag, Julen Lopetegui and Luis Enrique are the options being vetted by United, with the Spain boss proving the most complex situation to navigate given the World Cup in December. The club want a manager in situ ahead of the new season, but suggestions that a pre-agreement could be struck by the end of this month are, as one employee put it, ""overly optimistic."" While there is some bafflement from United over why Lopetegui and Enrique have been faded out of talk surrounding the job, multiple sources have admitted they would be surprised if Pochettino or Ten Hag were not at the helm. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There is a split over the pair. The Argentine would not require an adjustment to the league, to a club of such scale, or even having to pit his wits against Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp. Pochettino is seen as the concrete choice to rival Manchester City, Liverpool and Tuchel's Chelsea given he stacked up well to the former two while on severely restricted resources at Tottenham. His work at Spurs, Southampton and Espanyol have been given more attention than the spell at Paris Saint-Germain, where the problem has not been the manager as the successes of Carlo Ancelotti, Unai Emery and Tuchel after departing, have proven. United are aware Ten Hag is the popular choice, and the Marc Overmars scandal has made it easier to prise him from Ajax. However, there remains question marks over how he would function in a completely different structure, and at a club of the size, stature and unrelenting pressure and attention as United. One source revealed that ""in an ideal world, Julian Nagelsmann would walk into the club this summer,"" but there is a realisation that he would not swap Bayern Munich until he could move to a stable Premier League option, primed to lift silverware. There is a sense he is more minded to plump for the City or Liverpool job when Guardiola and Klopp leave. United's new permanent manager will be derived from the four-man shortlist unless ""there is a massive change in circumstance and a top manager that fits the long-term direction suddenly becomes available.""

The German head coach's future at Stamford Bridge has come into question in recent weeks in the wake of sanctions placed on Russian owner Roman Abramovich, with Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher leading calls for United to make a move for Tuchel. But the Blues boss has reiterated his desire to stay at the club, which he claims gives him ""everything he needs to make me happy"". ""Actually no reaction at all [to the rumours],"" said Tuchel in a press conference before Chelsea's FA Cup quarter-final at Middlesbrough. ""Do you feel me less committed to the club or less involved in the club? Absolutely not. ""I have said many times that I love to be here and this club has everything it needs to make me happy.

Chelsea fixtures Latest Chelsea news Premier League table Get Sky Sports ""I think it is realistic in that if you are Manchester United why wouldn't you ask that question?"" Carragher added. ""Unfortunately with the situation that Chelsea find themselves in, other clubs will be looking at their situation in terms of players or managers going forward, that's the nature of the beast.

And those managers are very few and far between right now."" Final bids for Chelsea are due in at 9pm on Friday evening, with the Raine Group based in New York controlling the sale of the club on Abramovich's behalf. Among 200 different groups have registered an interest in the club, but Tuchel claims he will try and maintain the culture that currently exists at Chelsea, no matter who succeeds Abramovich as owner. ""I am an employee and that's why I'm ready to play my role and adapt,"" Tuchel added. ""Let's see what's coming. It's uncertain times and uncertainty can create for some people fear and that's completely normal. ""But we can also trust in what we have in the culture of the club and what we have here in Cobham and the quality of the group. We can trust in that and trust for a good outcome. We stay positive and hopefully it will come like this. Hopefully they [the new owners] love winning, that would be a big plus."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Chelsea have been drawn against Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals, but they currently cannot allow any of their fans to attend either of the two legs due to the sanctions placed on Abramovich. Tuchel confirmed that the club are in talks to try and get round these restrictions - with the German vowing that the board will do everything they can to get Chelsea fans in the ground for the European contest. ""It's a tough one,"" said Tuchel when asked about the task of facing Real Madrid. ""The challenge couldn't be much higher, playing the second leg in the Bernabeu with their spectators. ""It's a big challenge and a big excitement around this match and this fixture. We know what's coming and it will be an exciting match and a tough challenge.

Jarrod Bowen scored his 13th goal of the season to floor Lampard and Everton must regroup ahead of their relegation six-pointer against Burnley on Wednesday, live on Sky Sports. West Ham led through Aaron Cresswell's spectacular free-kick but were pegged back by Mason Holgate's deflected effort. Bowen struck again for West Ham almost immediately, and the visitors finished the match with 10 men after captain Michael Keane was sent off. The travel-sick Toffees still hold the worst away record in the country and are only one place above the drop zone in what has been a torrid season - but Lampard saw signs of improvement despite a 10th away defeat. ""The performance was good and we deserved more from the game,"" the Everton boss told Sky Sports. ""A lot of things went against us today, which is how it has been going for us. But there were a lot of positives against a good team. We certainly deserved a point against a good team. ""We showed character, discipline and created chances which isn't easy against West Ham. If we carry on in that vein, things will go in our favour."" West Ham 2-1 Everton - Match report and highlights Everton fixtures Get Sky Sports Watch Premier League highlights When asked what would determine his side's fortunes during the closing weeks of the campaign, Lampard added: ""Finishing and goalscoring, it is talent and work on the training ground. ""The work doesn't always replicate on the pitch but you have to keep going. Every player and team goes through moments. We created the better chances today and enough to score two or three goals. If we do that we win games and we have 10 more to do that. ""Ten games is a lot. If our luck turns and we keep on the path we showed today and against Newcastle I have a real strong belief we will be OK. Saying that now here means nothing. We just have to focus on ourselves. The next game is huge because it is Burnley but also because it is our next game. After that we move on to Manchester United. ""You want to win games. Today isn't so enjoyable. It is not if you don't turn up and get opened up as a team. It has happened a couple of times since I have been here but not much. But that comes with the territory of where we are at. Look at West Ham. Today they are very strong but two or three years ago they are facing relegation. ""And then they build, stick together and recruit and they move on. Everton has huge history and a fanbase. At the moment we are working to get through this moment. Myself and the players are giving everything. The fans can know if we keep doing that over 10 games we will be OK."" West Ham are still just about challenging for a place in the top four and look at the very least capable of back-to-back top-six finishes, something manager David Moyes used to deliver regularly when he was in charge at Goodison Park. Everton were dealt a blow when Donny van de Beek sustained a muscle injury in the warm-up, meaning a late selection for Holgate. ""It is not ideal to lose Donny in the warm-up but you deal with it and I think we did,"" Lampard added. ""The reshuffle was done well in terms of Mason coming in from playing centre-back recently to midfield."" Keane will now be suspended for the game against his former club Burnley game this Wednesday, and Lampard said: ""The next game is always the most important. We can't think in blocks of games - the next one is a competitor down in the same end of the table and nobody gets an easy game at Burnley. ""It's a fact at all times so it's about continuing with the application and character of our performance today. We need to keep working. ""When things are going against you - and they are - that's not a whinge but clear decisions recently and injuries... the only way to react is by doing the right things and keep working. So on Wednesday, when Richarlison goes through [on goal] the ball goes in, and when the other team get a free-kick, it doesn't go in the top corner. We have to stay focused on ourselves and believe in ourselves for 10 games."" Sky Sports' Ben Grounds at the London Stadium: The misery continues for Everton. Bowen inflicted more away-day pain for Lampard's side but here they were the authors of their own downfall, beaten by their own lapse in concentration before the red mist descended. Keane captained the side in the absence of Seamus Coleman but it was his tired challenge on Antonio which made life more difficult moments after West Ham had regained the lead. Lampard had questioned his players' bottle - or words to that effect - after they capitulated at Crystal Palace in the FA Cup last time out, and they conceded poorly again just five minutes after equalising when Bowen struck. Keane's second yellow card capped another miserable road trip for Lampard, and he simply cannot afford yet another fruitless jaunt away from Goodison Park on Wednesday in that crucial game against Burnley at Turf Moor. Everton remain safe, for now, but defeat to Sean Dyche's side would close the gap to the bottom three to just a point. As Richarlison trudged disconsolately down the tunnel, Lampard must pull his troops together for the battle that lies ahead. Former Everton winger David Ginola told Sky Sports: ""It gets worse and worse and when you are in a situation like that, especially when you have to play against teams who are competing against you and fighting relegation. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""The game against Burnley will be another crucial one for Frank Lampard. So many games lost already for a manager who all the fans were expecting to take the club out of that situation. They are under pressure and he is under pressure. ""You can lose one game but over a 38-game season, if you are in this position it's because you are not good enough."" Sky Sports' Graeme Souness: ""You can't fault that group for their effort but I'm afraid it just comes down to they have don't have enough quality at this level to be winning games away from home. They don't have enough quality and for me that's the top and bottom of it. The league doesn't lie."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  West Ham boss David Moyes, who spent 11 years as Everton manager, is confident his former club will avoid relegation. Moyes, who was Everton's longest-serving manager since Harry Catterick in 1961-73, believes Lampard's side have the quality to remain in the Premier League, despite them taking just six points from 14 away games this season - the lowest of the 92 sides in England's top four divisions. ""I think Everton will be OK,"" the Scot said. ""I think when you have the quality of the forward players that Everton have got, it gives you a great chance [with a] Brazilian centre-forward and an England centre-forward. ""I think they've got players in the wide areas who can score goals as well, so I think Everton have got a lot of good things going for them. ""I think they should feel more positive about it, but I understand [as] I've been there recently when I've not stayed up with Sunderland, I've been there a couple of times with West Ham when I have and it's not a good place to be and you never know how it is going to go.

""If he meant from seeing us today and feeling how we were as a team, and if we continue with that form, then I agree. ""But we're in that position and we know the reality of it.

Antonio Rudiger had put Chelsea ahead at the start of the second half with a stunning long-range strike but a Vitaly Janelt double either side of Christian Eriksen's first Premier League goal since his comeback from a cardiac arrest last summer swung the game in 10 minutes. Yoane Wissa then made it four in the final stages. It was a scoreline similar to the surprise 5-2 win West Brom pulled off at Stamford Bridge almost exactly a year ago. That match, like this one, was the first after the international break and Tuchel accepted his side may have been mentally drained from playing around the world. However, he said that did not entirely explain the outcome of the contest. ""It was strange because we were working hard for the first goal and we know how hard it is to create chances against Brentford,"" he said. ""They defend either very high and man mark or defend very deep in a block of 10 men around the box. You need to be patient, have a fluid rhythm and intelligent and clinical to take little chances to have that first goal and break that block down. ""Once we had [the opener] we stopped defending and gave three goals away in 10 minutes. It was very untypical and killed the game for us. Chelsea 1-4 Brentford - Match report & highlights Download the Sky Sports App Premier League table Live football on Sky Sports Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""I don't know why we gave away a big chance straight after the goal and then the next one and from there we did not defend mature enough. We were not aware of the danger in these moments which is also very strange for us. ""We got punished. They made the most of these 10 minutes, which is maybe also not normal. It's a summary of strange events. It's on us. It's our fault."" Tuchel believes that as well as the international efforts - which included the mental strain of a penalty shoot-out win to get to the World Cup for Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy - his team were also hindered by less time to prepare, fired-up opponents and even a shift in the weather. ""It was a tough start for us, we felt a bit leggy which is normal after international break. But after 20-25 minutes we controlled the match, we controlled the rhythm, we were getting more and more fluid, created half chances,"" he said. ""Second half, I was very happy with the start, finally we had the goal, which is normally exactly what we want to open up new spaces. But the opposite happened and I don't know why. ""My expectations were not too high. It's difficult to play after international break. It's a challenge to play as a favourite on top of it. To dictate the match and break down a well organised and physical team. But we were in the lead and in charge. ""I felt us getting better and better. We got a beautiful goal. I don't know exactly why we lost control for the next 10 minutes. ""Were we distracted by the Real Madrid game? Absolutely not. We selected the team that we thought was the best team. Not 1 per cent on Real Madrid. ""Maybe if we'd lost it 1-0, 2-0, 3-0 going down and starting too late but it wasn't the case. We started slow in the beginning but that was more tired, not physically tired but mentally tired, not fresh enough. ""Yesterday we were wearing gloves and it was snowing during training and today it was very warm. ""It's more difficult for us than for them to play as an underdog and be well prepared for this match. We were also well prepared but we were prepared in one and a half training sessions. I didn't see the distraction there."" While the exact cause of Saturday's performance isn't entirely clear, Tuchel is convinced it will just be a blip for his team who had won their last five in the league. ""After so many wins and so many good results I refuse to make a drama out of it because why should we,"" he said. ""Brentford made a lot of the 10 minutes we gave them. After the third goal we had a disallowed goal, we had a pressing situation against the goalkeeper, a big, big chance for Havertz, we missed three of them and a feeling 'this is not our day'. There are some reasons we can put on us and we will analyse."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Meanwhile, Brentford boss Thomas Frank was understandably delighted with his team's display and praised the influence of Eriksen. ""Christian is a top player, an unbelievable character and he brings quality and calmness to the team. You can give it to Christian and he'll always find a solution,"" he said, before discussing how the player has returned to the top level. ""From the beginning I thought 'everything has been checked in his entire body'. He didn't have an injury like an ACL and when he took that decision that he wanted to play in the World Cup, that determination, 'I want to come back into football' [was there] and his foundation physically was quite good. ""We never knew how quick it would take to get to this level but it's impressive how quick."" Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson expects Chelsea to spend little time dwelling on Saturday's shock result, with a Champions League tie against European giants Real Madrid around the corner. ""4-1 wow, I didn't think I'd ever sit on this show and call that score out,"" he said, speaking to Jeff Stelling on Soccer Saturday. ""Chelsea have got a big game next week - Real Madrid on Wednesday, they've got to pick themselves up. ""I just think Chelsea aren't the same team when they don't play a back three. I don't think Chelsea are good like that [playing a back four]. Brentford did their homework; they were very good. That's what football is like. Real Madrid will probably come to Stamford Bridge on Wednesday and get beat, that's football. It's a big week for Chelsea. Massive week. ""I expect them to get in the top four still. It would have to be a massive collapse, in my opinion. But, if they keep putting in performances like that, getting beat at home to Brentford, it won't be long before the others close the gap.""

The 27-year-old has signed a contract until June 2024, with the option of a further year. United's hopes of signing the left-back appeared to be fading after their offer was initially rejected by the Portuguese champions, who were holding out for £22.5m. However, negotiations began again on Sunday morning, with Porto changing their minds on United's most recent bid as they were convinced that no subsequent offer was likely from Old Trafford, with the transfer window about to close for Premier League clubs. ""To join a club with the prestige of Manchester United is a huge honour,"" said Telles. ""You have to work hard to get to this moment in your career and now I am coming to this club, I can promise that I will give everything in my heart to be a success here. ""I won many trophies at FC Porto and I want to continue that at United. The manager has a clear plan and direction for this team and I can't wait to pull on the famous shirt."" Telles signed for Porto from Galatasaray in 2016 and went on to win two Portuguese league titles and the Portuguese Cup in nearly 200 appearances for the club. Man Utd transfer rumours Spurs hit six as shambolic Man Utd implode Ole takes responsibility for defeat Man Utd's defence in disarray He becomes Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's second signing of the window, following Donny van de Beek's move from Ajax. Solskjaer said: ""He is a player we have been tracking for some time and his performances over the past few years are exactly what we are looking for. ""He is a fighter and a winner and will add real determination and competition to the squad. ""Alex has the qualities, both as a player and as a person, that we want here at Manchester United."" Telles will fly to Sao Paulo to join the Brazil national team ahead of World Cup qualifiers against Bolivia and Peru. Atalanta winger Amad Diallo will join Manchester United in January. United reached an agreement with the Serie A club for Diallo, who has been on the radar of United scouts since 2016, when he was spotted playing at U15 level. United will pay around €20m plus €21m in add-ons (£37.2m) for the 18-year-old, who looked set to join Parma until the deal collapsed. The transfer is subject to Diallo passing a medical, agreeing personal terms and being granted a work permit. Diallo made the move to Atalanta's academy in 2015 and was handed his senior debut last October in the 7-1 victory over Udinese. The youngster found the net after coming off the bench in that game and in doing so he became the first player born in 2002 to score a goal in Serie A. Sky Sports' Ron Walker: It doesn't take long watching Telles in action to see his main quality strikes a similar chime to that of many Brazilian full-backs, with his productivity on the ball a major asset to Porto in recent years, registering some 54 assists across his five years at the club. While United's main defensive problems may lie in the heart of their defence, there is certainly a strong case to be made about how the Brazilian can improve their backline. While Luke Shaw and Brandon Williams, the club's two regular left-backs in 2019/20, failed to register a single assist between them across the campaign, Telles was busy making eight goals for his Porto team-mates in the Primeira Liga, which may come as little surprise from a man who attempted almost 10 crosses per 90 minutes on average, and completed around a quarter. Much may be said about his goal tally, too, as he found the back of the net 11 times last season, but with eight of those coming from the spot, fellow Portugal import Bruno Fernandes may have a thing or two to say about that at Old Trafford. ""He is very Brazilian in his approach,"" Vitor Goncalves of Portuguese national broadcaster RTP told Sky Sports. ""His passing is very good - that's one thing that makes him different, even from other Brazilian left-backs."" In isolation, Telles' passing stats don't make remarkable reading, the fact he created 57 chances, the seventh-highest tally across the entire division, certainly does. But just as Brazilian full-backs are known for their attacking prowess, so too has their defensive quality been called into action at times. ""He's not so good defensively,"" Goncalves adds. ""But he's still a defender over a winger! He's a top Porto player, and the vice-captain behind Danilo Pereira."" If Manchester United are looking for a defender to shore up a backline which has already shipped 12 goals in its opening three games - a third of their tally for the whole of 2019/20 - Telles may not be the answer. But with much of their problem during that season an inability to break teams down who played with a low block, he will add some quality from wide areas and a goal threat from the back which the club has undoubtedly been lacking. Adding to the defensive options is timely for Manchester United, who were humiliated by Tottenham on Super Sunday. This 6-1 defeat was only the second time United have let in that many in a Premier League game at Old Trafford. They had not let in four in the first half of a league match since 1957 before this one. Sky Sports' Gary Neville described the performance as ""pathetic"" but perhaps the most alarming thing is it had been coming. United's defence has been in disarray this season. Crystal Palace's 3-1 win at this venue in United's first game of the season two weeks ago was a shock. Roy Hodgson's side were the second-lowest scorers last season, while United had let in just seven in their final 14 Premier League games of 2019/20.

A week on, Leandro Trossard hit the woodwork five times before United escaped Brighton with a last-gasp 3-2 win. Victor Lindelof - inconsistent throughout his time at the club - lost his Premier League place at the heart of United's defence for the visit of Spurs, but the returning Eric Bailly fared little better alongside a badly-out-of-sorts Harry Maguire.

However, one player who does look likely to be joining United is Edinson Cavani, who is close to signing a two-year deal. The 33-year-old striker is a free agent after leaving Paris Saint-Germain at the end of last season, and is set to bring some valuable experience to United's youthful forward line.

In the 2018/19 campaign, Diallo scored 18 goals and delivered 13 assists and his impressive performances paved the way for him to begin training with Atalanta's senior squad.

After weeks of negotiations, the clubs held positive talks in the past days and a deal worth €15m plus €5m in add-ons was eventually struck. Smalling, who has signed a three-year deal at the club with the option of an additional year, had been pushing for a move to Roma throughout the summer, where he impressed last year on a season-long loan. ""Nothing in life worth having comes easy,"" Smalling told Roma's club website. ""My head and my heart has always been in Rome. I am delighted to now be yours. Daje Roma!"" Smalling also issued a farewell message to Manchester United supporters and has claimed that although he joined Roma on a temporary basis last year, he ""instantly"" knew it was going to be his long-term home. ""It all began in July 2010, and now 10 years, 323 appearances, 2 titles, and 6 cups later it has come to an end,"" Smalling said on Twitter. Man Utd transfer rumours Deadline Day LIVE!

The 30-year-old had been frozen out at Old Trafford following his return, training on his own and was omitted from all of United's matchday squads this season. United had eight centre-backs on their books including Axel Tuanzebe, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo and academy product Teden Mengi - with Smalling not part of boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's plans. ""Everyone at Manchester United would like to thank Chris for his years of service, dedication and professionalism, and wish him all the best for his future,"" United said in a club statement. Smalling was Roma's top target this summer and the Serie A side have approached United multiple times in pursuit of a permanent deal but their offer fell short of the £20m asking price. Inter Milan and Newcastle were also interested in the centre-back this summer after his three goals in 37 appearances for Roma last year. Smalling returned to Old Trafford in August after the clubs were not able to find an agreement to extend his loan to cover the Europa League finals, where Roma suffered a round-of-16 defeat to winners Sevilla. ""We are pleased to be able to welcome Chris back to the club, as one of the pillars of our squad,"" Roma chief execuitve Guido Fienga said.

United have spent well over £250m on players since Solskjaer took the job permanently in March 2019, including big-money moves last season for Harry Maguire, Bruno Fernandes and Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Donny van de Beek arrived in September this year and Edinson Cavani is the latest high-profile signing at Old Trafford, with the club completing a deal for the former Paris Saint-Germain forward - as well as Brazil left-back Alex Telles - on Deadline Day. United finished third in the Premier League last season but have started 2020/21 disappointingly. Home defeats to Crystal Palace and Tottenham - the latter a 6-1 thrashing - and a fortunate last-gasp win at Brighton have seen the club heavily criticised once again. Speaking to Sky Sports News, Mitten - the editor of fanzine United We Stand - says although supporters don't trust United's recruitment policy, Solskjaer has to start delivering results on the pitch with the players he has signed. ""There's just so little faith in the recruitment system because it's been so mish-mash since 2013 and the club have spent a huge amount on players, but most of it has been spent really badly,"" Mitten said. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""I did have confidence that Ole Gunnar was bringing in better players and was identifying better players and if you would have asked me three or four months ago - Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Bruno Fernandes, Dan James - I would have spoke pretty well about all of them. Less so now after the start to the season. Man Utd sign Cavani on one-year deal Man Utd sign Telles from Porto for £15.4m Premier League ins and outs How much did your club spend? ""They're players who have played well in the past and I hope they'll play well again in the future, but it is baffling how players who have looked so good collectively are now looking so bad. ""United need to start getting results. It will not be acceptable if the club start this season and in the run-up to Christmas with as few wins as they had last year. There are minimum expectations and Ole Gunnar's got to get results. ""I think the fans are still behind him. He's been criticised because any team should that concedes six goals at home in a Premier League game - following on from another home defeat - and I think he holds his hands up himself and takes the blame for that. ""United fans would love it to work out with Ole Gunnar but are there doubts? Absolutely. Just as there were with Jose Mourinho, with Louis van Gaal, with David Moyes. It's this rinse and repeat cycle which frustrates Manchester United fans. ""Ole will have been in the job for two years this coming December. I've long maintained that he needs support, but he's now brought in a lot of players which he's sanctioned. He didn't get Jadon Sancho and I understand the reasons why. £108m is way too much in this current environment. ""United have conceded 11 goals in the first three Premier League games. It's been a really turbulent start to the season and I think everybody's got to take some part of the blame for that - the players and the manager as well. Ole's got to deliver now. He's got to deliver trophies."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  In April, United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward said the club had the financial capability to be competitive in the transfer market, although he did admit they were not immune from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. United completed four signings in the 24 hours that followed their 6-1 mauling to Spurs even though Jadon Sancho, who United had chased all summer, remained at Dortmund and potential moves for Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele and Watford's Ismaila Sarr failed to materialise. ""It's caused a lot of frustration among fans and a lot of the goodwill which built up towards the end of last season has faded away,"" Mitten said. ""Up until yesterday Manchester United had only signed Donny van de Beek and then the four signings on Deadline Day. The mood wasn't good, especially after the game at Old Trafford on Sunday and I wouldn't wish that on any Manchester United fan. It was absolutely horrendous. ""The four signings have come in and I'm looking forward to seeing Cavani in a Manchester United shirt - as I am with all the players - but the fans have got very little faith in the club's recruitment system and in the club's ownership structure."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Cavani - who has scored 341 goals in 556 club appearances during his career - has signed a one-year contract with the option of a further 12 months and will wear United's iconic No 7 shirt. The signing of the 33-year-old has already faced scepticism, with Sky Sports' Paul Merson among those to question the deal, but Mitten is hopeful the Uruguayan will be a success. ""I actually quite like the opportunistic signings,"" Mitten said. ""I called Diego Forlan who knows far more about Cavani than I ever will. I said 'just be straight with me - is he still a good player?' and he said 'yes, absolutely' and I know him well enough for him to say to me 'no, he's gone'. ""He will be a leader at the club. We know he can't speak English yet - but with his professionalism and the way that he trains.

Many will be excited, some unsure, and others frustrated. Everton and Aston Villa are first and second respectively in the Premier League table with new signings playing a key part in their strong starts to the season. Meanwhile, Manchester United's poor results at the beginning of the campaign have highlighted the weaknesses in their squad that have still not been addressed. As for Burnley, what must Sean Dyche make of it all? Here, we pick out some of the winners and losers of the 2020 summer transfer window... Everton made it four wins out of four with their 4-2 victory over Brighton and it has escaped nobody's attention that their summer signings have played a vital role in their bright start to the season. The midfield, previously a problem area under Carlo Ancelotti, has been transformed by the arrivals of James Rodriguez from Real Madrid, Allan from Napoli and Abdoulaye Doucoure from Watford. Transfer window 2020: Done deals Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports New football season calendar Transfer Centre LIVE! Premier League kits for 2020/21 The trio did not come cheaply but the early evidence suggests the investment was well worth it. James has brought guile and creativity, scoring three goals and providing two assists already, Doucoure has brought an injection of box-to-box energy, while Allan has offered defensive steel and ball-playing composure in equal measure. Suddenly, Everton look like a balanced side, and their new recruits are also helping to bring the best out of the players already in place at Goodison Park. Dominic Calvert-Lewin's free-scoring start to the season has earned him an England call-up, while Richarlison has been similarly impressive. The hope will be that the late arrival of Robin Olsen on loan from Roma will see Jordan Pickford up his game too. There is even reason for optimism at the back. The £20m Ben Godfrey endured a difficult season with Norwich last year, but it gave him invaluable Premier League experience and, at just 22 years old, there is plenty of scope for him to fulfil his considerable potential on Merseyside. Godfrey is a ball-playing centre-back in the mould of Mason Holgate, and, like his new Everton team-mate, he is viewed as a future England international. He may not go straight into the team, but Ancelotti will certainly hope to build around him in the future. He'll also hope his other defenders benefit from the increased competition for places. Jose Mourinho can have few complaints about the club's summer dealings. Gareth Bale was the headline addition, of course, sealing a sensational return to Spurs on loan from Real Madrid. And with Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son starting the season in such explosive form, Spurs fans are entitled to feel optimistic about what will be possible when Bale is fit to start too. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg has brought leadership and combativeness to Tottenham's midfield, but it's the signings of Matt Doherty and Sergio Reguilon which are perhaps the most significant. The pair are attacking wing-backs who will allow Mourinho to switch between a back four and a back three. Doherty and Reguilon will aim to provide ammunition for Carlos Vinicius as well as Kane, Son, Bale and the rest. The Brazilian has joined Spurs on loan with a £36m option to buy having averaged a goal every 101 minutes for Benfica last season and should ease Mourinho's reliance on Kane in the central striking position. With Steven Bergwijn, Lucas Moura and Giovani Lo Celso also at his disposal, and with Dele Alli staying at the club despite interest from Paris Saint-Germain, it is little wonder Mourinho has been heard purring over Tottenham's ""absolutely incredible"" attacking options. If there was one area that Tottenham still wanted to strengthen going into Deadline Day it was the centre of defence, having failed in an effort to bring in Milan Skriniar from Inter Milan. Joe Rodon remains a target and while a deal for the Swansea defender could not be done on Monday, the window for signings from the EFL does not close until October 16. There is still time for Spurs to make an impressive summer of business even better. With their transfer ban finally lifted, Chelsea went all out this summer. Timo Werner, Kai Havertz and Hakim Ziyech arrived in attack, Thiago Silva and Ben Chilwell were added in defence, and there was even a deal for a goalkeeper, with Edouard Mendy arriving from Rennes to provide a much-needed alternative to Kepa Arrizabalaga. Suddenly, Frank Lampard's squad looks well-equipped to aim higher than just a top-four finish. It has not been a straightforward start to the season, of course, with defeats to Liverpool and Tottenham as well as a crazy 3-3 draw against West Brom. But the 4-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday was the first sign of Frank Lampard's new-look side coming together. It helps, of course, that he still has a stellar collection of young players at his disposal too. He will need to find a way to continue giving them opportunities to grow and improve, but recent evidence suggests the influx of new additions has served as a motivation for them. It was, after all, only thanks to goals from Mason Mount, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Tammy Abraham's that Chelsea salvaged a draw against West Brom, and two of that trio then kept their places in the side for the 4-0 win over Palace. Chelsea's strength in depth could prove invaluable in a gruelling season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Aston Villa signed no fewer than 12 new players last summer, but they have taken a 'less is more' approach this time around and their brilliant start to the season suggests they were right to do so. There has been no hint of panic buying, instead their recruitment has simply targeted the flaws in their squad. Emiliano Martinez has provided an instant upgrade in goal following his arrival from Arsenal, while it has been a similar story with Matty Cash at right-back. It is further forward, though, that their summer dealings look most inspired. Villa were well short up front last season - Jack Grealish was their top scorer in the Premier League with eight goals - but Ollie Watkins already looks like the right man to lead the line having adapted to the division seamlessly and hit a perfect hat-trick in the 7-2 demolition of Liverpool. Bertrand Traore offers added depth in the position and showed his class with his brilliant strike against Bristol City in the Carabao Cup, while Ross Barkley has provided an injection of physical power and technical quality in midfield. The 26-year-old, signed on loan from Chelsea, was outstanding on his debut on Sunday. Villa only survived by a point last season, but they look more like top-half finishers this time around and that's thanks to an excellent summer in the transfer market. Having beaten the reigning champions in such exhilarating fashion, some supporters might in fact be aiming even higher. Arsenal's deal to sign Thomas Partey - the biggest of Deadline Day at £45m - capped an extremely encouraging summer for the Gunners. There was no Houssem Aouar, who stayed put after Arsenal's negotiations with Lyon came to nothing, but Partey joins Willian and Gabriel Magalhaes at the Emirates Stadium while the Gunners also struck deals to ensure Dani Ceballos, Pablo Mari and Cedric Soares extended their stays in north London. Mesut Ozil remains at the club, meaning Arsenal will likely have to continue paying his huge wages until his contract ends next summer, but they did succeed in moving some others on, including Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Matteo Guendouzi and Lucas Torreira. They also raised £20m from the sale of Emiliano Martinez to Aston Villa. The result is that Mikel Arteta is now equipped with a squad which looks far more like his own, and what's most important of all, of course, is that he was able to tie Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to a new contract. There is a long way to go before they will be considered genuine title contenders again, but their summer business should at least set them up for a top-four push. Liverpool sit somewhere between the winners and the losers of this summer's window. On the one hand, they have signed Thiago Alcantara, a genuinely transformative midfield signing, for a paltry £25m from Bayern Munich. In Diogo Jota, they have also recruited a high-quality back-up option for their front three. Konstantinos Tsimikas, meanwhile, provides depth at left-back. But on the other, there is concern that they remain short in key areas. With Joe Gomez and Joel Matip injured and Dejan Lovren sold, they started the season with only one fit centre-back in Virgil van Dijk. Fabinho filled in ably in the win over Chelsea, but Gomez endured a calamitous afternoon in the 7-2 thrashing by Aston Villa and a lack of depth in the position is a gamble with such a hectic schedule to come this season. There are also question marks in goal. Adrian struggled again when deputising for Alisson against Aston Villa - he has now made five errors leading to goals in his 21 appearances for Liverpool - but with the Brazilian facing four to six weeks out with a shoulder problem, Klopp is short on alternatives to the former West Ham goalkeeper. When Leicester reached September having yet to make a major addition to the squad, despite selling England left-back Ben Chilwell to Chelsea, there was some unease. Throw in the poor finish to last season that saw Brendan Rodgers' side miss out on Champions League on the final day and anxiety levels were rising in the East Midlands. While it would be an exaggeration to say that Leicester's business since then has wowed supporters, some of the concerns have since been addressed. Timothy Castagne can play in either of the full-back positions and has already won over fans after a strong start. Cengiz Under adds that little bit of creativity in the final third that is always welcome. But it is the late acquisition of Wesley Fofana that Rodgers will hope solves the problem of a lack of depth in defence that saw Wilfred Ndidi pressed into action at centre-back on the opening weekend of the season. With three wins from four games to open their Premier League campaign too, the Leicester ship looks to have been steadied again. Wolves reshaped their squad during the transfer window and it will be intriguing to see whether the ins and outs see the team progress under Nuno Espirito Santo or compromise the cohesion so that has been such a factor in their success over the past two seasons. Matt Doherty was sold to Tottenham with Nelson Semedo coming in from Barcelona, while Diogo Jota departed for Liverpool after Wolves invested £35m in teenager Fabio Silva. The loan signing of Rayan Ait-Nouri looks to be a clearer case of the club strengthening, with Ruben Vinagre making way to join Olympiakos on what is initially a temporary deal. Whether the manoeuvrings are enough to take Wolves forward remains to be seen. The frustration surrounding Manchester United's transfer window hit new heights as they were thrashed 6-1 by Tottenham on the penultimate day of the window. At that point, their only new signing was midfielder Donny van de Beek, a £37m addition from Ajax who is yet to start a Premier League game. More reinforcements arrived on Deadline Day, with Alex Telles sealing his move from Porto, Edinson Cavani joining, and youngsters Amad Diallo from Atalanta and Facundo Pellistri, but there was no deal for Jadon Sancho despite their summer-long pursuit and supporters are entitled to wonder why it took until the final hours of the window for Manchester United to get their business done. The spotlight is firmly on executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward for his role in what has been another difficult transfer window for the club, with Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville leading the criticism. ""Not good enough,"" was his blunt assessment of Woodward's dealings during Sunday's miserable thrashing by Spurs. The club will hope the players they have signed can make a difference - the club's recent record in the transfer market before this window has certainly not been bad - but performances will need to improve rapidly in order to change the mood. Spare a thought for Sean Dyche. The Burnley boss has been operating on a shoestring budget throughout his time in charge at Turf Moor, but this summer has surely been the most difficult yet. His depleted squad saw him unable to name the full complement of substitutes at times after the lockdown last season, and despite an urgent need to bring in reinforcements, the club reached Deadline Day with back-up goalkeeper Will Norris and 31-year-old midfielder Dale Stephens as their only senior signings of the transfer window.

Manchester United have not given up on trying to sign the 20-year-old England international, despite missing the August 10 deadline the Bundesliga club set for the deal to be completed. The Dortmund hierarchy have stated on several occasions - before and after the deadline - that if it was not met Sancho would remain at the club, but rumblings have continued over United submitting a bid before the transfer window closes on October 5. But a move to Old Trafford now seems extremely unlikely in the next few days following comments by the Dortmund skipper. Asked if Sancho had made the right call to stay and had the potential to be as good as Cristiano Ronaldo, Reus told Sky Germany: ""For us players that was great news.

""We all were happy that he will be with us for one more year because he delivers assists and goals, so we get points. ""If he gets as big as (Lionel) Messi or Ronaldo, we will see.

To find out what is really going on behind the scenes, you have to look at the deal from three different points of view - Manchester United, Borussia Dortmund and the player and his representatives. Manchester United are not giving up on trying to sign Sancho despite the fact that they missed the Monday deadline Borussia Dortmund set for the deal to be done. That was an artificial deadline set by Dortmund. In an ideal world, it would have suited Dortmund to have Sancho's future sorted out by the time they flew out for their pre-season training camp in Switzerland. Sancho is still United's No 1 target this summer and as far as they are concerned the window is open for almost another two months. There is no need for United to press the panic button. As far as they are aware they are the only club who are trying to sign Sancho and he wants to move to Old Trafford. They are frustrated at the way things have turned out so far but it is still early days in the window and United have time on their side. United are still in the Europa League and they are well within their rights to wait until that competition is over before they put in an official offer for Sancho. Transfer Centre LIVE! Man Utd won't give up on Sancho Man Utd transfer rumours Expert panel: What is Sancho worth? Although United have been in contact with the two agents Dortmund want them to deal with, they have made little progress so far. Talks have centred around the fee, the payment structure, personal terms and agent fees. There are mixed messages as far as personal terms and wages are concerned. United insist they will not pay over the odds even though Sancho is not believed to be asking for higher wages than other players with a similar profile. United have let it be known that they will not pay Dortmund's €120m (£108m) asking price but they are going to have to get close to it if they really want Sancho. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player According to Bild in Germany, United raised the possibility of signing Sancho for €60m in informal talks with agents. That kind of offer would not even be worth presenting to Dortmund. The coronavirus pandemic has affected all clubs and budgets are tight, but a 50-per-cent discount on one of the best young players in the world would be laughed at by the men who run Dortmund. Nothing that has happened this week has changed anything as far as United are concerned. They know Dortmund are willing to sell Sancho. All United have to do is show them the money. And one final point: if Dortmund are not willing to sell Sancho, why have they engaged the services of the agent they used to sell Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Arsenal and Ousmane Dembele to Barcelona? It is significant that Michael Zorc came out and said what he did, when he did. He is the Dortmund sporting director and they wanted to take control of the situation. When he walked over to the reporters at the side of the pitch on Monday he knew exactly what he was doing. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He made it clear that Sancho would be staying at Dortmund and the decision was final. The big question is should we take what he said at face value or is it simply a negotiating tactic? As far as our colleagues at Sky Germany are concerned, Sancho is now more likely to stay at Dortmund. It would be difficult for Dortmund to back down now after what they have said in public. And it is not just Zorc who is saying that Sancho is staying. His team-mates Erling Haaland and Emre Can have also been telling the media how delighted they are that Sancho is staying and how they are looking forward to playing with him again next season. So should we really believe Dortmund when they say United have missed the deadline and Sancho is staying? Dortmund's business model is based on developing players and selling them for big transfer fees. They have bought Haaland and Jude Bellingham this year and their finances have been hit by the pandemic, so they would find it difficult to turn down a big offer for Sancho. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Having said that, Zorc revealed on Monday that they had extended Sancho's contract last summer. He is now contracted to Dortmund until the summer of 2023 and that puts Dortmund in a strong position. As far as they are concerned, they can hold onto Sancho for another season and wait until next summer to sell him. By then, club finances may have improved and the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona would be in a better position to make moves for Sancho and drive his price up. Dortmund have shown time and time again they are more than capable of looking after themselves and protecting their interests in the transfer market. After all, this is a club who stood their ground over Ousmane Dembele and only let him join Barcelona when they had agreed to pay £135m. That was a short time after Zorc had said Dembele wold not be sold. Zorc also said Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang would not be sold before he moved to Arsenal. The message from Dortmund is coming through loud and clear - if you want our best players, you have to pay what we want. As each day goes by, it becomes increasingly clear that there is no way Dortmund will let Sancho leave for less than £100m this summer. And in public, they will still insist that he is not for sale. The former Premier League striker Jan Aage Fjortoft, who is now a broadcaster and German football expert, summed up the situation perfectly: ""In Germany they say Zorc is strong; in England they say he is playing poker."" It is no secret that Sancho would like to come back to the Premier League. He feels he has unfinished business in England because he did not get the chance to prove himself at Manchester City. Sancho has friends at United and now is the perfect time for him to come home. He wanted to move to a club who were in the Champions League and United finishing third last month was another box ticked for Sancho. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It would suit United if Sancho started agitating for a move but there is no sign that is going to happen. If Sancho came out and said he wanted to leave or if he put in a transfer request United would be in a stronger position. There is no indication that is something Sancho is planning on doing. After all, he can hardly be expected to agitate for a move when United have not made an offer for him. Without an offer, there is no chance of Sancho rocking the boat or in time-honoured fashion, developing a mysterious 'back injury' which would prevent him from training or playing in pre-season friendlies for his current employers. Sancho will keep his head down and keep working hard. He wants to move to United but another season with Dortmund and another season in the Champions League is not the end of the world.

If a United move does not materialise this summer, then Real Madrid, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool would all come into play next summer. And that will be a summer in which Sancho will be showing the world just how good he is in the Euros with England. The summer transfer window will run for 10 weeks from July 27 and close at 11pm on October 5.

United are not giving up on trying to sign Sancho - who is valued at £108m - despite Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc insisting the 20-year-old winger will not be sold in this window. Catch the Premier League season on Sky Sports for just £25 p/m for 12 months (usually £33.99 p/m) However, despite the Bundesliga club's stance, during the last 24 hours progress has been made between United and Sancho's representatives on the issues of agent fees and personal terms. ""I've been speaking to somebody close to a potential deal involving Jadon Sancho to Manchester United and in the past 24 hours there have been developments and potentially good news for Manchester United fans, because the issues of agent fees and personal terms, I've been told, are no longer a problem,"" Sky Sports News reporter Sheth said. ""Manchester United are remaining tight-lipped on these developments but it's clear that some good progress has been made on overcoming the problems of agent fees and wages. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""We understand that United remain very resolute and determined to not overpay for a player given the realities of the coronavirus pandemic, but given that this was the issue for the past two or three weeks that Manchester United weren't making a bid because they needed to sort out agent fees and personal terms for Jadon Sancho, this appears to be some sort of a breakthrough. ""It's our understanding now that the agent fees and the personal terms are not going to be a problem anymore."" Sancho remains Man Utd's No 1 target Transfer Talk: Ole's strategy taking hold Man Utd transfer rumours Transfer Centre LIVE! United's chances of convincing Sancho to come to Old Trafford will have been enhanced by securing Champions League qualification, but they also view Dortmund's €120m (£108m) valuation for the player under the current coronavirus conditions as ""unrealistic"" for someone who the German club themselves signed for £7.2m three years ago. The club are also unwilling to break their wage structure for the England international following the unsuccessful transfer of Alexis Sanchez. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  United have completed big-money moves for Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes in the last two transfer windows but feel the environment for deals has shifted since the coronavirus pandemic - with fees reflecting the tough financial conditions. Sheth continued: ""You could say the onus is now on Manchester United to go to Borussia Dortmund with an official offer and say 'this is how much we are offering for Jadon Sancho, do you accept?' ""The fact of the matter is that as of August 10, Borussia Dortmund had set their own deadline. £108m should have been on the table and if it wasn't, Jadon Sancho stays at Borussia Dortmund, he goes nowhere. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""At the end of the day Borussia Dortmund have said he's not for sale. However, if Manchester United then decide to, from this positive development, say 'we are going to Borussia Dortmund with an offer', even though Borussia Dortmund have said he's not for sale, the likelihood is that any offer at the moment would be rebuffed or rejected. ""However, two things could potentially happen and have to happen for this deal to be properly resurrected. Number one, Manchester United have to go in and make an official bid and number two, Jadon Sancho will then have to go to Borussia Dortmund and say 'I know you say I'm not for sale, but I do actually want to talk to Manchester United'. ""That then changes the landscape of this deal because Borussia Dortmund have said since August 10 that he's not going anywhere, but if Jadon Sancho then comes to Borussia Dortmund and says 'I want to go to Manchester United', what do Borussia Dortmund then say to their fans? It's up to Manchester United now to make that formal offer to set off that chain of events. ""So there has been a development with regards to agent fees and personal terms, but we haven't even got to the point where Manchester United are dealing with Borussia Dortmund. That will now be the next step."" Sancho has enjoyed a meteoric rise in Germany's top flight and registered 17 goals and 16 assists in 32 Bundesliga games last season. United are actively exploring alternatives to Sancho in case they cannot complete a deal for their No 1 transfer target in the current window. The club's recruitment team has compiled a shortlist of players who could also fill the right-wing position that United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has targeted as a priority as he seeks to improve on last season's third-place finish in the Premier League. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News confirmed in July that Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman is one player who United could move for, but on a potential loan instead of a permanent deal. Although positive progress has been made on the issues of agent fees and personal terms in negotiations with Sancho's representatives, United would be prepared to walk away from the deal unless Dortmund lower their demands.

While United kicked off their season with a deserved defeat to Palace, Neville lays the blame for the surprise loss squarely at the feet of those who are responsible for bringing new players to the club this summer. Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, the one-time United captain warned his former side unless a number of new signings are made before the transfer window closes on October 5, they could face missing out on a top-four finish this season. Download the Gary Neville Podcast on: Spotify | Apple | Castbox | Spreaker Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player United looked like a team who were well short of fitness and football, players missing, not got the players in who they wanted, short in confidence in some areas. Issues off the pitch in the last few weeks which might have distracted them and Crystal Palace exploited every single weakness Man Utd had. But make no mistake about it, the shape of Palace, the way in which they interpreted the 4-4-2, they did not go back to a back six, like so many teams do - they really kept the four together narrow, which mean the wide players - Schlupp and Townsend - were able to counterattack. The front two worked really well together and sprung off that United midfield McTominay and Pogba who were sat deep. It was a really well put together performance, they even got to the point where they were starting to show confidence on the ball, it was not just counterattacking and defending, they started to show possession and a little bit of arrogance. Upcoming Man Utd fixtures Live football on Sky Sports this week Transfer Centre LIVE! Find out more about Sky Sports They toyed with United and they more than deserved the win and there was the debacle over the second Palace goal, the penalty - I thought it was a nonsense, I really did - but the fact they got the third goal took away the element of, 'Oh, Man Utd were hard done to.' There were no excuses, Palace were by far the better team and if they can maintain that level of commitment and keep the players fit, they could have a really good season. They look like they could win a lot of football matches this season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Because of what has happened in the last eight years, people have lost their confidence and they have now tried to go the other way in terms of, 'we can't now overpay'. You see Liverpool getting a player for £40m, £25m, you see other clubs do it, Werner is quite cheap compared to some of the prices of players you see in the market and United always seem to have to pay top dollar and the people at the club will not like that, almost as though they are easy pickings. And there is a suggestion of that. The problem is, they have to find a way to get deals done and they can't get deals done efficiently. And it is negligence not to get the squad in place, they have had six months since March when lockdown was on being able to deliberate, do zoom calls, connect with agents, move things into place. Catch the action for only £25 a month with this limited time offer. Watch the Premier League, Formula 1, PGA Tour and much more. Cancel any time. There is no excuse really for not getting your transfers done before the start of the season. They need four or five players, so to only get one done… I know Liverpool have only got theirs done in the last couple of days, but there is a feeling they are in control. United have got the money - if they can spend £90m-100m on Sancho, they have got the money to do the deals. They have not got the quality or experience of football people within that club, it looks like a convoluted and complex structure, I'm not quite sure where the decisions lie. Liverpool are definite, they are precise. Look at Chelsea, they are definite and precise, Man City are, but Man Utd do not seem able to get their business done. And that unfortunately has been a massive problem, whether it be signing the wrong player…. I think the recruitment has been better and more precise in the last 18 months. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  But there is still that issue of not being able to get the players over the line quickly enough, in the building, with the squad, to get that team ready for the start of the season. And then you end up with that on Saturday and what that does is make them weaker, because now clubs who they are wanting players off will be looking it and thinking, 'we will relax because they are going to come and knock on my door, they are going to have to'. And that is the problem Man Utd have got - they have not got the authority and control in the transfer market. The people who are hearing these words and seeing them, they will not like it. But they have got to hear it, because they are not doing their jobs. The football players on the pitch did not do their jobs, the manager is going to get accused of not doing his job. The people in the stands whose job is to put that team on the pitch, build a football team that can win the league and the people in the stand who have been at Man Utd for eight years now have not had the ability to build a football team that can win the league. And that is a problem, that is your job - to build a football team to win the league and they have not been able to do it. And they have to find a way of doing it quickly as these years are going to drag on. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  You have seen Liverpool, we are going to see Man City on Monday night, we have seen Chelsea, not quite at their best, but they are investing and they have young players coming through. Man Utd have got to see the danger signs here - they could end up in fourth or fifth again if they are not careful and last season was a step forward.

United finished a distant third in the Premier League last season, 33 points off champions Liverpool, and Keane reckons Solskjaer cannot afford for that chasm to repeat itself this time around. ""The remit will be different for Ole this year,"" Keane told Monday Night Football. ""I think last year, it was about getting into the top four - I know they got to three semi-finals - but it will be higher this year. ""They will certainly have to get a bit closer to Liverpool and Manchester City. The points total cannot be the same as it has been over the past three or four years. ""Ole will probably have to get his hands on a trophy. I think the honeymoon period is certainly over for Ole, and the pressure starts to mount now, particularly with the performances like that over the last week or so."" When asked if failure to finish in the top four could signal the end of the road for Solskjaer, Keane added: ""Yeah, I think so. If you're the manager of Man United, and they can invest in the next week and buy one or two... if they don't invest in the next week, then it's tough days ahead."" United's haphazard performance against Brighton left much to be desired as Bruno Fernandes' penalty in the 100th minute secured a dramatic 3-2 victory on Saturday.

Bruno Fernandes converted from the penalty spot with the last kick of the game 10 minutes into added time to snatch three points for United from a crazy, incident-packed encounter. Referee Chris Kavanagh had initially blown for full-time before awarding the spot-kick having consulted the pitchside monitor and opted to penalise Neal Maupay for handball. United boss Solskjaer admitted his side were fortunate to avoid dropping points for the second successive match following last weekend's shock loss to Crystal Palace and wants his players to make a habit of grabbing late goals. ""I don't think we've ever scored after the final whistle, that's right,"" Solskjaer said. ""But, of course, the handball was before full-time so it's probably right thing to do. ""For us it's a big thing. We have discussed it this season, we need more late goals. We were the team that lost the fewest games - apart from Liverpool - last season. But we drew too many. To get two extra points after conceding the equaliser so late on is a great boost for us. ""We've got to be honest enough to say they created the most chances. They had loads of shots, they had big chances. We need to improve a lot in the weeks coming forward."" Brighton 2-3 Man Utd - Match report How Brighton and Man Utd lined up Match stats Get Sky Sports Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Albion looked to have secured a point they more than merited when Solly March cancelled out Marcus Rashford's fine solo effort - which United said was the 10,000th in their history - five minutes into time added on. But, after players from both teams surrounded match official Kavanagh during a remarkable ending to the game, Fernandes confidently dispatched the ball from 12 yards. Frenchman Maupay had earlier cheekily chipped Brighton ahead with a 40th-minute penalty - his third goal in two games - following Fernandes' foul on Tariq Lamptey, but Lewis Dunk's fifth Premier League own goal levelled matters just 194 seconds later. United also had two efforts disallowed for offside, while the Seagulls rattled the frame of the goal five times and had another spot-kick award overturned following a VAR review. Solskjaer joked he was grateful his predecessor Jose Mourinho was not at the Amex Stadium to measure the goal posts after impressive Albion remarkably struck the woodwork five times. Former United boss Mourinho made headlines in the week by pointing out that the goal posts were too small ahead of Tottenham's Europa League qualifying win over North Macedonian side Shkendija. Referring to that incident in connection with Brighton's series of near misses, Solskjaer added: ""We got away with one. Maybe one point we deserved; we didn't deserve more. You have to be happy Jose is not here to measure the goal posts!"" Brighton boss Graham Potter conceded that losing a ""rollercoaster"" encounter in such dramatic circumstances was painful. Leandro Trossard claimed a hat-trick of sorts by striking both posts and the crossbar, with Adam Webster and March the other men denied by the woodwork. Potter, whose side host United again in the Carabao Cup fourth round on Wednesday, was unsure why so much additional time was played. ""It was a bit of rollercoaster, to say the least. A fantastic performance from us, we did so much well and played with real courage, real quality,"" he said. ""Obviously, very, very sore to lose but we have to try and be as philosophical as we can and focus on the things we did well. We had such a high in terms of when we scored our equaliser because I felt we deserved that. ""The emotion at that moment, we felt we scored on the last kick. There couldn't have been much time left and, I don't know, the referees are responsible for the time, that's their job. From our perspective, we are just very disappointed."" You read correctly.

The decision to award United a penalty came after referee Chris Kavanagh had blown the full-time whistle at the Amex Stadium. So why was the game brought back for United to take the match-winning penalty? We take a closer look at how the most dramatic of finales unfolded... Fernandes coolly converted from 12 yards with the last kick of the game in the 100th minute after referee Kavanagh penalised Neal Maupay for handball having consulted the pitchside monitor. Players from both teams surrounded Kavanagh during a remarkable ending as he consulted VAR and pointed to the spot after initially blowing the full-time whistle. Maupay was found to have blocked Harry Maguire's goal-bound effort with an outstretched arm and, after an on-field melee, Fernandes dispatched the ball high into the top-right corner for the final say in a crazy south-coast encounter. Simply, because the full-time whistle was blown after the incident and not before, and the incident took place in normal time. The VAR - Simon Hooper - was able to check, irrespective of the full-time whistle that followed. Brighton 2-3 Man Utd - Match report Solskjaer: We got away with one How Brighton and Man Utd lined up Match stats As play had officially been brought to an end, Fernandes' penalty was the last kick of the game, so if Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan had saved it and the rebound was scored, it would not have counted. If a penalty kick has to be taken or retaken, the half is extended until the penalty kick is completed. IFAB Law 2 also states: ""If at the end of the half, the referee leaves the field of play to go to the referee review area (RRA) or to instruct the players to return to the field of play, this does not prevent a decision being changed for an incident which occurred before the end of the half."" Solly March's header looked to have sealed Brighton a deserved point in the fifth and final minute of stoppage-time, but there was still time for Manchester United to mount a late push for a winner... Maguire sent a looping header towards goal that struck Maupay's outstretched arm before being cleared off the line by March. Referee Kavanagh blew the full-time whistle, sparking remonstrations from Maguire and his Manchester United team-mates. Despite calling time on the contest, a referee Kavanagh is instructed to take a second look at the incident on the pitchside monitor in the referee review area. On second glance, Kavanagh spots the infringement from Maupay and points to the penalty spot amid similarly heated protests from Brighton players and staff.

The midfielder moves to Old Trafford for a fee of €39m (£34.6m) - plus another €5m (£4.4m) in add-ons - and has signed a contract until June 2025 after completing a medical in the Netherlands on Monday. The 23-year-old will travel to the UK after his country's Nations League games against Poland (September 4) and Italy (September 7). The completion of the deal before those fixtures means he will not need to self-isolate for 14 days, the government confirmed to The Transfer Show. Van de Beek said: ""I cannot begin to explain how incredible an opportunity it is to join a club with such an amazing history. I would like to thank everyone at Ajax, I grew up there and I will always have a special bond with the club. I am now ready to take the next step in my career and perform at the highest level and there is no higher standard than Manchester United. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""Everyone has told me how amazing the Old Trafford atmosphere is and I am looking forward to experiencing that, once it is safe for the fans to return. ""This team has some of the best midfielders in the world and I know that I can learn from them and also bring my own strengths to the group. Having spoken to the manager about his vision for this team, the direction that the club is going in is hugely exciting and I cannot wait to be a part of that."" He has chosen to wear the No 34 shirt as a tribute to his former Ajax team-mate, Abdelhak Nouri, who suffered brain damage after having a heart attack during a game in 2017. Where will Van de Beek fit in? Why Van de Beek was in demand? Latest Man Utd transfer news Transfer Centre LIVE! Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was delighted to complete the deal, and said: ""Donny has all of the technical attributes needed to perform in this team and has the personality required to succeed at Manchester United. His ability to see space, time his movements and read the game will really complement the qualities that we have in midfield and his arrival really strengthens the depth of talent we have in that position. ""Donny's performances in the Eredivisie and in Europe have been excellent over the last few years and we are all looking forward to working with him."" United had scouted Van de Beek extensively, with the player left out of Ajax's squad for the Dutch champions' friendly with Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday amid rumours of an imminent move away. Van de Beek helped Ajax reach the 2018-19 Champions League semi-finals, scoring four goals along the way and 41 in all competitions over the last three seasons. He had been repeatedly linked with a move over the past few months, with Ajax chief executive Edwin van der Sar revealing in May the midfielder would be allowed to leave, but only for a suitable fee. The player was also close to joining Real Madrid prior to the coronavirus pandemic, but did not undergo a medical or sign an agreement with the club. Van de Beek becomes Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first signing of the summer transfer window and could make his debut when United begin their Premier League campaign against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on September 19, live on Sky Sports. Sky Sports' Nick Wright... Donny van de Beek has been a key figure for Ajax over the last three seasons, helping them reach the Champions League semi-finals in 2018/19 and scoring 41 goals in 175 appearances overall. He had been scouted extensively by Manchester United, according to Sky Sports News, but will Ole Gunnar Solskjaer be able to fit him into the same midfield as Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba? Van de Beek is best known for his attacking qualities. He has provided a regular stream of goals and assists from midfield during his time at Ajax. He also ranks highly in terms of recovering possession in the final third, further underlining his tendency to play high up the pitch. But with Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba already in place at Manchester United, he may be needed in a deeper role at Old Trafford. Solskjaer favours a 4-2-3-1 formation, and while Van de Beek's record suggests he would be best suited to the No 10 role in that system, there is little prospect of Fernandes losing his place in the side. Van de Beek is therefore more likely to be paired with Pogba at the base of midfield as an alternative to Nemanja Matic. Read the full feature here... Sky Sports' Charlotte Marsh... Donny van de Beek was a man in demand, but why did he garner so much attention? With incredible versatility, Van de Beek can operate in a central or attacking role and has been described as the classic box-to-box midfielder. The 23-year-old has the ability to play anywhere across the middle - a trait that will only increase his value - and as well as being that vital link between defence and attack, he is more offensively minded than other central midfield players. He has developed that special talent of making late runs into the area to latch onto forward passes, catching out even the most astute of defenders. But he is also not afraid of sitting deep and doing the hard work when he needs to. According to WhoScored.com, Van de Beek makes an average of two tackles per game in the Eredivisie - the fourth highest in the Ajax squad - and can help out in a more defensive role when needed. Even fellow countryman and former Ajax assistant manager Dennis Bergkamp had him pegged as a special talent at a young age. In quotes carried by the Daily Mail, Frank de Boer, who Bergkamp worked under at the club, recalled: ""Dennis started talking enthusiastically about a talent in his youth team. It was a boy who reminded Dennis of himself at that age. That was the signal for me to keep an eye on that guy. That was Donny.""

The Wales captain has completed a remarkable return to Premier League, seven years after joining Madrid from Spurs in what was a world-record £86m transfer. The 31-year-old flew to London on Friday after completing a medical in Madrid, with Spurs agreeing to pay about £20m in wages and loan fees. He was accompanied by team-mate Sergio Reguilon, who also completed a move from Real to Spurs in a separate five-year deal. ""It's nice to be back. It's such a special club for me where I made my name, what an amazing club with amazing fans, it's incredible to be back,"" Bale told the club's website. ""Hopefully now I can get some match fitness, get underway and really help the team to win trophies. ""I always thought when I did leave that I would love to come back one day, the opportunity has now arisen and I feel like it is a good fit at a good time. Tottenham transfer rumours Transfer Centre Everton impress to defeat 'lazy' Tottenham Bailey still wants PL move, Spurs interested ""I am hungry and motivated to do well for the team.

""You don't realise until you are there in finals and those situations. Hopefully I can bring belief into everybody that we can win trophies. The target is to do that this season, I want to bring that mentality back to Tottenham. ""Since I have left the club has been building, the stadium is incredible, the training ground is better than before. It's an exciting time."" Bale, who won two La Liga titles, four Champions League trophies, as well as the Copa del Rey in a trophy-laden spell in Spain, will wear the No 9 shirt at Spurs. It has been a turbulent year for Bale, who fell out of favour under head coach Zinedine Zidane - with whom he has shared a strained relationship with in Madrid - and came close to leaving for Chinese side Jiangsu Suning last summer. The player revealed in an interview with Sky Sports earlier in September he would be open to a return to the Premier League if the Spanish club would let him go. Bale only managed three goals in 20 appearances for Real Madrid last season, but has now returned to the club where he made his name as one of the world's best footballers. It will take the player up to a month to be fully match fit as he increases the firepower of a team that already has Heung-Min Son and Harry Kane. Tottenham's head coach Jose Mourinho recently admitted he had always been a fan of the player, but failed to sign him when he managed Real Madrid. Mourinho added the Spanish club took his advice and bought the player after Mourinho left Madrid in 2013. Sky Sports News reporter Ben Ransom in Madrid... On Thursday, when Gareth Bale left the Real Madrid training ground for the final time, his departure was met with apathy by the dozen or so fans waiting at the gates for a glimpse of their heroes. Compared with the clamour for Luka Modric to give them so much as a wave, it struck me how far Bale has fallen in the eyes of the public here. Both players joined following standout seasons with Tottenham Hotspur, and both have played a key role in winning no less than four Champions League titles. But the similarities end there, as one will forever be tarnished by his failure to fully embrace what it means to be a Real Madrid player. I've heard much criticism of Bale during my stay here, from fellow media professionals and supporters alike, with the most common accusation being his failure to integrate himself into the Spanish culture during his seven-year stay. Not learning the language has undoubtedly held Bale back here in the eyes of the public as he has never been able to fully connect with them, and vice versa. No surprise then to hear anecdotes of him slowly becoming more insular as time has gone on and finding solace on the golf course. That's despite Bale continuing to delight on the pitch with moments of pure magic, such as the overhead kick against Liverpool in 2018, one of two goals that brought the European Cup back to the city for a 13th time. Goals like that should have been career-defining, and perhaps one day the fans here will reflect upon all the good things Bale did for the club, rather than focus on the negatives. Injuries have taken their toll and will almost certainly have caused the man himself every bit as much frustration as the club paying his wages. An increasingly difficult relationship with Zinedine Zidane has reduced Bale's playing time further, and there is an overwhelming feeling Zidane's desire to get rid of the man who was once the world's most expensive player is best for all parties. I should add I've encountered little animosity for Bale. Many fans simply wish him well for the future, but in many ways that only reinforces the lack of passion within this relationship. Despite a hugely expensive marriage, Los Blancos have never truly won Gareth Bale's heart, perhaps a return to his former love in north London will unlock his passion for football once more. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Bale has enjoyed much of his success on the right wing and - despite those infamous White Hart Lane chants reminding Harry Redknapp that he 'plays on the left' - it is there that the 31-year-old forward would expect to be deployed on his return to the Premier League. In the autumn of his career, those bursts of pace down the outside are likely to become more infrequent but Bale will surely retain the ability to cut inside and find enough space to fire off shots from distance with his favoured left foot - something that he does better than almost anyone. In the final season of his first spell with Spurs, Bale scored no fewer than nine Premier League goals from outside the box - which was as many as the two next best players that season combined. Indeed, nobody has come close to matching that tally since. Even after a season of relative inactivity, clubs are interested in that kind of firepower. Manchester United's pursuit of Jadon Sancho indicates that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is not yet ready to entrust the role on the right to Mason Greenwood alone and wants more than a mere deputy. Read our full feature here to read why Bale chose Tottenham over Man Utd and if he can be a success in the Premier League again. Dwindling game time begs the question whether Bale still possesses the power and prowess that earned him Galactico status back in 2013. He has never completed more than 75 per cent of possible minutes in a La Liga season, primarily through injuries and, more recently, dropping out of favour - resulting in him clocking a career-low 31 per cent of possible minutes last term. The interactive graphic below shows a range of per 90 stats, revealing how his numbers have indeed dipped in recent seasons after hitting peak form for Madrid in 2015/16. Since 2018/19, Bale has averaged far fewer goals and created far fewer chances, while his frequency of attempted dribbles has been in decline for five of the previous six campaigns. Interestingly, his number of ball recoveries dipped significantly shortly after his move to Madrid, which could have resulted from adapting to the league style - but Jose Mourinho would expect more and is keen to improve Spurs' pressing higher up the pitch. Bale has been primarily deployed as a right winger with 174 starts in this position since 2013/14, but has also reaped considerable success down the left with 20 goals in just 36 appearances, while he could also provide much-needed cover for Harry Kane up top. How does he compare among the best in Europe's top five leagues now? Last season, his per-90 returns still ranked among the elite for touches in the opposition box and aerials won. But, as the radar graphic below reveals, he produced mediocre numbers for the majority of attacking stats. When factoring he was playing for the La Liga champions elect and his advancing years, question marks remain over whether the Welsh wizard has lost his hunger at Real, or lost his edge.  The signings of Gareth Bale and Sergio Reguilon could see Tottenham's formation change as Jose Mourinho completes one of the biggest tactical shifts of his long and illustrious managerial career. Bale's return would be a major coup for Spurs and reignite enthusiasm from supporters but the onus would be on Mourinho to make best use of his undoubted ability.

Reguilon, who will wear the number three shirt, travelled to London on a private jet owned by Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy on Friday morning, alongside Gareth Bale. Both players successfully completed medicals in Madrid on Thursday and are likely to meet conditions that will enable them to avoid quarantining in the UK. Along with having arrived from an elite sporting environment where coronavirus protocols have been adhered to, the players will both need to have returned negative test results within five days prior to entering the UK. Reguilon, 23, was named the best left-back in La Liga for his performances last season while on loan at Sevilla. However, Real Madrid are well-stocked in the position, with Brazil international Marcelo and France's Ferland Mendy already in their squad, so were keen to sell Reguilon to raise funds to balance the books.

Liverpool will pay £20m for the Spain international, with the potential for a further £5m in add-ons, and the midfielder will wear the No 6 jersey. Thiago arrived in the UK on Friday morning, flying in to Manchester from Munich to complete a medical and finalise the deal. Listen to the Transfer Talk podcast on : Spotify | Apple | Spreaker The 29-year-old helped Bayern win the treble last season, as they beat Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League final last month in Lisbon. ""I think it's an amazing feeling. I was waiting for this moment for a long time and I am very, very happy to be here,"" Thiago told Liverpool's official website. ""When the years are passing, you are trying to win as much as you can - and when you win, you want to win more. I think this club describes what I am as well; I want to achieve all of the goals, win as many trophies as possible. How Thiago could transform Liverpool Transfer Centre LIVE!

""Everything is more compact and we started a little bit later, but still it is football and I think we have to mix all the big things up, all the good things we have. I will help the team in a defensive and offensive [way] and also in a mental aspect. ""[The fans] are not more excited than I am - for sure not! It is not about saying words, it is about doing the things. I will give my heart on the field to my team-mates, the club and also to the fans."" When he left the Bundesliga club, Thiago took to social media to post a goodbye video which said: ""I have made the most difficult decision of my sports career. ""I will close this chapter in this wonderful football club where I have grown as a player for seven years. ""Triumphs, joys and also hard times but what I am most proud of is that I arrived in Munich as a young man full of dreams and now I will leave completely fulfilled with the club, a history and a culture. ""Here I learned to love a tradition that I am now saying goodbye to but which I will never forget. ""My decision is purely a sporting nature as a soccer player, I want new challenges to develop myself further. Bavaria will always be my home, thank you FC Bayern."" Bayern boss Hansi Flick paid tribute to Thiago on Thursday, saying: ""Thiago is an exceptional player who spent seven hugely successful years here. ""He's a wonderful person and an outstanding professional. It was very emotional today when he said goodbye to us all."" Thiago started his career at Barcelona and was handed his debut for the Catalan side by Pep Guardiola in 2009 at the age of 18. He was an unused substitute as Barca beat Manchester United in the Champions League final the following season. Thiago joined up with Guardiola again in 2013 when the then-Bayern boss took him to Bavaria. He went on to win seven Bundesliga titles and four DFB-Pokal cups. Sky Sports News reporter Kaveh Solhekol told The Transfer Show: ""Liverpool signing Thiago shows how high Liverpool's standing is right now in world football because this is a player who is the best in the world at what he does. He's been at Bayern Munich for seven seasons, he's won a title every season, he's just won the Champions League and was one of the best players in the competition last season. ""Bayern were aware his contract was running out next summer. They put a new contract in front of him, a four-year deal and they thought it was all agreed, he was going to sign on the dotted line but at the last minute, he had a change of heart and decided to leave this summer. Bayern decided to let him go and he wants a new challenge which is at Liverpool. ""From Liverpool's point of view, Bayern were initially asking for €30m and there was no way Liverpool were going to pay that. The way they have structured this deal is that they are paying £20m but over four seasons so £5m per year for Thiago. When you look at it like that, it is the best lease purchase deal I have ever seen to get a player that good for just £5m per year. ""That's why a lot of Liverpool fans on social media are saying their sporting director Michael Edwards is a genius."" Sky Sports News reporter Vinny O'Connor: ""Liverpool's stance throughout the summer was that they would not be signing Thiago Alcantara - that changed a little a couple of weeks ago when the suggestion was they would only try to sign him if someone was leaving, but they did not believe that was going to happen. ""Now Liverpool have decided to go ahead regardless of that and they think Thiago is the man for them. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Jurgen Klopp had also been consistent throughout the summer - Liverpool would not be doing business unless a really good opportunity presented itself and a deal was there to be done. ""This is a deal that Liverpool could not turn down. ""At 29, Thiago does not necessarily fit the FSG [Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool's owners] model of buying players young, coaching them and increasing their ability and value, but the out-and-out quality of Thiago, combined with his experience of performing on the biggest stage, meant this particular move was a no-brainer. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""He is a player for the here and now, untested in the Premier League but someone who is used to performing on the biggest stage for Barcelona, Bayern and Spain. ""The signing should also help to solve an issue that Liverpool have recognised recently - Trent Alexander Arnold alluded to it in an interview a couple of weeks ago - the game plan needs to change. ""It has been in the back of Liverpool's minds to change the dynamic in midfield. It is not a case of things going stale but they are keen to give the opposition something else to think about now. Liverpool have been playing the same way for a couple of years and Thiago brings them something completely different. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""The signing of Bayern Munich's treble-winning midfielder renews that competition for places and says to the other players in that position they have to raise their game again. ""They have now decided to move from a position of strength to freshen things up and give other teams something new to think about."" Sky Sports' Adam Bate: The commentator was just saying how comfortable Paris Saint-Germain were looking when it happened. ""They are quite happy for Bayern to have the ball in their half,"" he said. But it was at that precise moment that Thiago Alcantara weaved his magic, firing a crisp pass between the lines. The ball was in the back of the net seconds later. The goal was enough to win the 2020 Champions League for Bayern Munich and while scorer Kingsley Coman was the official man of the match, the role of Thiago in the team's triumph escaped no one. At 29 and reluctant to sign a new contract, Bayern realised they might have to sell. Liverpool have pounced and it is easy to see why. Jurgen Klopp's side can do almost anything. But they cannot do what Thiago can do… Read the full feature on what Thiago would offer Liverpool here Sky Sports' Adam Smith: His CV tells the story. At 29 years old, Thiago has racked up 11 league titles with Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Since his league debut, he has only ever missed out on the domestic crown once - back in 2011/12. If that was not enough, what else interested Jurgen Klopp? The reduced fee from his dwindling contract was undoubtedly attractive, but so too are his strengths - in particular, his ability to press opponents. Thiago played only 106 minutes in the Bundesliga after the restart due to a groin injury Only Wolfsburg's Maximilian Arnold reclaimed possession in the middle third more than Thiago in the Bundesliga last season - and he played 1,055 minutes more than the Spain international. Thiago also offers an improved dimension to Liverpool's existing midfield tranche: the ability to run with the ball. His frequency of completed dribbles is outstanding, given the fact he patrols central areas of the pitch. In addition, the 29-year-old retains possession, despite his forward-thinking drive and above-average number of passes attempted - clocking a passing accuracy of 90.5 per cent, which ranks 21st in the league. Thiago provides unrivalled pedigree, with 12 years' experience at powerhouse clubs and nine with Spain, while fitting the mould for a midfielder under Klopp. The summer transfer window will close at 11pm on October 5.

United bought Donny van de Beek from Ajax in a deal worth up to £39m, but the midfielder remains their only summer arrival despite efforts to sign £108m-rated Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho. Throughout the summer, Solskjaer's side have also been linked with moves for Gareth Bale and Sergio Reguilon - who have both joined Tottenham - and new Liverpool midfielder Thiago Alcantara. However, United boss Solskjaer has not given up on bringing in fresh faces before the window closes. ""We're looking at a small pool of players who can add to the quality of our team and let's see what we can do. The club's working hard and I understand that they're working hard,"" he said. ""When we sit down and we discuss, sometimes it doesn't happen as planned. Life isn't a straight line here, sometimes things happen and I've always said it - I'm very happy to work with these players. ""There's still a few weeks left of the transfer window, it might happen that we get someone in.

His philosophy of signing young, hungry players has been clear during his 18 months in permanent charge, and the Norwegian reiterated his desire to bring in those who fit the club's character. ""I want players in the building that we want to work with and who wants to be a part of it and who wants to be here,"" Solskjaer added.

Catch the Premier League season on Sky Sports for just £25 p/m for 12 months - cancel anytime United's lack of transfer activity has led to widespread fan discontent, with calls for the Glazer family and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward to leave regularly trending on social media. Despite Solskjaer's preference to sign players as early as possible in the window, the United boss understands how the coronavirus pandemic has affected the market. ""You can't ignore the impact of coronavirus,"" Solskjaer said. ""I think that's really changed the market and it happened more or less in that period when maybe negotiations would happen. ""Of course, the financial uncertainty of that has added on the difficulty of predicting where we're at. ""You want always to have as long as possible with players. I think last season though shows that good players can adapt and grow into a group very quickly. Harry (Maguire) came in very late in the transfer window and he had a great impact on the performances in the team."" United finished third in the Premier League last season - significant progress on the previous campaign - but trailed champions Liverpool by 33 points and second-placed Manchester City by 15. Solskjaer insists the next step for his side must be to close the gap on their rivals and maintain consistency throughout the season. ""The next step is to move closer to the top two teams, let's see how much of that gap we can close,"" he said. ""Realistically, the two teams in front of us have been way ahead of the rest, it's a chasing pack and we want be the best of that chasing pack and who knows? Crazier things have happened in football. ""We'll just have to start the league well and have to be consistent. I don't want to take anything away from this group because we've added some top personalities. ""We've got Dean (Henderson) in, you've got Donny, Paul (Pogba) is fit now, Bruno (Fernandes) came in and his first game was February 1 or something like that so he's not been here long. Eric Bailly as well has come back, he looks fit and really good so we hope we can move forward and who's to say that we can't?""

Manchester United stand on the cusp of a new campaign with a renewed and realistic sense of optimism that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can take them to the next level.

The 36-year-old is out of contract in the summer and speaking to the press ahead of Man City's Champions League quarter-final second-leg clash with Atletico Madrid on Wednesday, the Brazilian, who has played more than 370 games for City in all competitions, revealed he is unlikely to extend his stay to a 10th season with the Premier League champions. When asked if he wants to leave the Etihad Stadium to play more, he said: ""Yes, I want to play. I want to play regularly. ""I will go back to Brazil. I decided with my family, which is the most important for me."" The former Brazil international, who signed a one-year contract extension last June, has won four Premier League titles and six League Cups since joining City from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013. Fernandinho later issued a statement on Twitter saying he had given an ""honest and spontaneous"" answer over his future and was fully committed to City's bid for the treble.

Fernandinho's potential exit was news to Man City boss Pep Guardiola, who was facing the media shortly after his club captain. When asked about Fernandinho's possible departure, Guardiola said: ""Oh! I didn't know. ""You give me the news. I didn't hear it. ""We will see what happens. I don't know what will happen. He is so important. I'll ask him.""

Ralf Rangnick admitted Manchester United do not deserve to finish in the Champions League spots if their performance levels for the rest of the season are similar to what they showed at Everton. United's ambition of finishing in the Premier League top four is receding and Rangnick was left to bemoan a toothless attacking display against an Everton side that lost 3-2 at relegation rivals Burnley in midweek. Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, the former United full-back bemoaned the abject performance at Goodison Park, and believes Ten Hag may even be thinking twice about taking over the reins this summer... I've got very few words left for Manchester United. No anger, no comment anymore. They are a bit of a farce; you almost expect it from them. The players are taking Ralf Rangnick down with them. They are bad. They've got to get to the end of the season as quickly as possible. The reality is that any kind of performance in the last week against Leicester and Everton and they would have been in top four, but they haven't got the spirit or the fight. When I look at Manchester City and Liverpool, they have humble football players; no over-inflated egos, they understand their position, the team comes first. There isn't one Manchester United player that would get into any of those two teams, so why would you have an over-inflated ego, think you didn't have to work hard, or be spiritless? I don't see anything anymore. The making of Erik ten Hag Man Utd fixtures Premier League table Get Sky Sports I've read in the Sunday papers that Erik ten Hag wants all of his demands met or else he won't come to the club. Imagine if they can't get Ten Hag over the line because of what's happening at the moment, and how bad a state the club are in. If you look at what Manchester United are doing to players, there isn't one who has grown. Look at what they did to Donny van de Beek. If you're Ten Hag, I think you're on the phone to Van de Beek. What's it like there, Donny? He's not saying anything good, is he? I suspect Ten Hag's demands aren't financial, they will be about control, recruitment, structure, youth. I suspect he wants to come in and make sure he's not exposed to what other managers have been exposed to in these last 10 years. That might be too much for Manchester United, and I suspect it may be difficult week or two for the club. I still think they will get it over the line, but the reports this morning were that Ten Hag was placing demands on the club that maybe go above and beyond. We shouldn't believe everything but, ordinarily, when things come out from credible sources we normally know. The old adage is not to believe anything we read in the press but that is false, journalists hear things from somewhere and if there are multiple sources saying the same type of story there is usually something in it. Things have all gone quiet on the Mauricio Pochettino front, so it all feels like it's all eggs in the Ten Hag basket. If they cannot get him over the line because of his demands on the way the club is run, what a position for Manchester United to be in. I suspect Ralf Rangnick will be speaking to Ten Hag honestly, Van de Beek will be answering him honestly. We know Edwin van der Sar is over at Ajax and will be speaking to Ten Hag honestly. They will be saying be very careful about going to Manchester United because it can be a graveyard for reputations at this moment in time. Ralf Rangnick came with an incredible reputation but he's now starting to be wounded by what's happening around him and he looks weaker and vulnerable on the touchline due to the performances of players on the pitch, who have nothing to do with him. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a good man, the players liked him and yet they turned him over. It's a real difficult position for the club to be at. I feel like most Manchester United fans at this moment in time in that I don't know where to turn next or what's going to happen. I'm living on the feeling that the club one day will return. The club will rise again but this is getting low, real low. But it will come back, and you look forward to that day. Those Liverpool fans over my shoulder have been where Manchester United have been, they have been in those low moments when Manchester United were winning, when they maybe didn't have a team they could be proud of. Maybe it's time for those Manchester United players to have a look at themselves. I do believe players want to do well, but what they are showing at this moment in time is nowhere near good enough.

The response from Liverpool in the second half was exceptional after being so poor, so below the standard in the first half. I always remember playing under Sir Alex Ferguson, if we played badly in the first half of a big game at the end of the season he would ask if we'd fought all season to play like that. It was almost as if at half-time Jurgen Klopp had to say, 'come on, we've built this team for three or four years and yet you've shown no authority, you've frozen, you've defended poorly'. I have to say, Liverpool responded brilliantly, and at the end of the game, considering where they were at half-time [it was a better point for Liverpool]. But City could have won the title today had they won the game; I don't think Liverpool could have because they have harder remaining games. But things move on, it wouldn't surprise me if both teams won every game until the end of the season and Liverpool are sat thinking 'I wish we played better in the first half?' But we don't know, there is still a long way to go. It was frenetic. Punch for punch. Some of the football we watched were exceptional, they put pressure on each other. Their defences pushed up so high. They stay true to their manager's principles, and they don't wilt. Liverpool have got real guts, they are streetfighters. What we saw in that second half was just the energy, passion, spirit, and fight that we have seen from Liverpool to come back. But City are a brilliant team, you can't really speak highly enough, there are no more words for these two in terms what they have achieved over the last few years. And they are going to go it in these last few weeks, hell for leather in the FA Cup, Champions League and Premier League. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It's an unbelievable rivalry - 338 versus 337 points. In terms of consistency, quality, and excellence, this has a case to be the greatest Premier League rivalry of all time. But when I think about rivalries, I think there has got to be more to it than that. Is there ferocity, intensity, a story to tell. When people talk of the Sir Alex Ferguson-Arsene Wenger rivalry there were incidents and stories to tell - the tunnel incident at Highbury, the FA Cup semi-final with Ryan Giggs' celebration, the Marc Overmars goal at Old Trafford that wins the title. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There were big moments between the two teams along with ferocity, fights, pizzas! There was more than just football excellence, so I don't think this Manchester City and Liverpool rivalry beats that yet. There were too many hugs - they like each other too much! I'm only joking, of course, but whether this will be a documentary in 25 years I'm not too sure. But in terms of excellence and consistency, it is an excellent rivalry. I admire what they are doing, it is absolutely brilliant, and the performance levels are high. You want to see this season go right to the death, you want to see both teams in the Champions League final, because when you think about the two best teams in Europe at this moment in time, it's these two competing in the Premier League, the FA Cup, and hopefully in the Champions League, they deserve it.

Phil Foden's 82nd-minute goal was shortly followed by the ball striking the arm of midfielder Rodri. Referee Paul Tierney had not given a decision on the pitch and VAR official Kavanagh ruled there was no reason to change that. The fury of the home fans was matched by that of coach Ashley Cole, who was shown a yellow card for his protestations to Tierney after the final whistle.

""The decision is incredible, incredible, and that loses us the opportunity to get what we deserved. ""That's a VAR call. That's Chris Kavanagh, I spoke to the referee and they know it is a penalty, the question is that is it offside and it wasn't. That's the reason we have VAR. It wouldn't have needed more than five seconds to know it was a penalty. He [Kavanagh] should have either told the referee to give it or told him to go look at it.

""Incompetence at best, at worst who knows? I'll wait for the statement or apology they do when things are wrong but it will mean nothing."" Lampard's comments will almost inevitably attract the attention of the Football Association, who take a dim view of managers criticising the integrity of officials, but the Everton boss was clearly frustrated at a decision that could prove crucial in Everton's bid to beat relegation. ""I was calm, I was not shouting and ranting at him,"" Lampard added to Sky Sports. ""I wanted to know if offside in the build up but I have been told it wasn't in the build up. ""Go to VAR, they have two minutes to look at it and to think they have not given that as a penalty when it strikes him on the arm, in an unnatural position. I have a three-year-old daughter at home who could tell you that was a penalty. ""We are fighting at the bottom of the table and they are fighting at the top. Decisions are crucial. I don't know what has to happen as a reflection of that. A mistake is when you have done something wrong and don't have time to think about it, they had two minutes to digest the handball. ""Even if the VAR says not sure, then go have a look. It is incompetence at best, if not that then someone needs to explain what it is."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Meanwhile, Pep Guardiola had a different view, saying he had not seen replays of the incident but believed the right decision had been made. Asked about the controversial decision to deny Everton a penalty for an apparent handball, Guardiola said: ""It was offside. There was VAR and the action was offside. I didn't see the image."" He added: ""When VAR reviews things anything can happen but I think the referee gave offside for the pass from Dele Ali to Richarlison, that is what I figured out in that moment. Everton midfielder Alex Iwobi: ""My friends have shown me and we all think its a penalty. We can't do anything about it now. ""When I was coming off at the end, Ashley Cole was saying 'it was a pen' and surprised the referee didn't have a choice to see it. ""We think it was clear cut. The decision has been made, we have to get on with it."" Manchester City forward Phil Foden: ""I was just praying, fingers crossed it was not a penalty. I didn't get a good sight of it but my heart was in my mouth."" Manchester City defender John Stones: ""I didn't get a good view of it when it happened. The ball went out and VAR checked and you are just waiting then.""

""It's just ridiculous. We've talked about VAR so many times and they have got so many things right, but this one they have got wrong, and it has cost Everton dearly. ""It's costing everyone involved in the Premier League. Forget Liverpool for a minute and what they are doing, Everton need to stay up. If they get a penalty and potentially a point out of the game, it enhances their chances. ""How can that not be clear enough evidence? We've just got to tell the truth and it is handball. Chris Kavanagh has got one wrong."" Sky Sports' Karen Carney: ""For me, it was a penalty. The ball then bounces up and there's back spin on it. Rodri puts out his arm and the ball hits it. ""Obviously, there is the T-shirt line rule, which means if it hits on the T-shirt it is not handball, but for me it is. I can't believe they didn't say to the referee go over to the screen and have a look. ""I can understand why the Everton and the Everton fans are aggrieved."" Sky Sports' Andy Hincliffe: ""We'd have to see whether Paul Tierney actually saw Rodri's arm and saw the ball. If he hasn't seen it, of course, VAR is there. They are constantly assessing the game. That is their job to then step in, asses that situation and then either make a decision or throw it back to the referee to go and have a look at the monitor. ""It looked pretty obvious to me that it was a handball. There's spin on the ball, Rodri's arm comes out and it seems to clearly strike his arm. ""I am a fan of VAR but on this occasion I don't understand them saying there is not enough evidence to see that the ball hit his arm. We've just seen the pictures again and it is obvious. You can also see how guilty Rodri looks. He knows his arm has come out and the ball has struck it. ""VAR took their time, there was no rushed decision and I thought clearly they were looking at this and they are going to give a handball. It was a handball and they don't even refer it back down to the referee. Hinchcliffe added: ""The referee is kind of looking through the body of Rodri. He hasn't got the best view, but he should be relying on his assistants and VAR."" ""That is what VAR is there for, situations like this where the referee has to think if he's seen it and can he see it. If they can't see it, VAR steps in and here, they should have done their job.""

Wales face a play-off against Austria in Cardiff in March and, if they win, they will then face a showdown against either Scotland or Ukraine for a place in the finals. Wales have not qualified for the World Cup since 1958 and Bale is keen to represent his country at the tournament before the end of his career. But if Wales fail at the play-off stage, retirement could be on the cards for Bale, whose Real Madrid contract expires at the end of the season. However, if Wales do reach their first World Cup in 64 years, Bale could consider signing a short-term deal with a Premier League or Championship side to ensure he is ready for the tournament. It is believed Bale, who turns 33 in July, could consider joining Cardiff or Swansea. Bale joined Real from Tottenham for a then world-record fee in 2013 and has gone on to win four Champions Leagues and two La Liga titles in the Spanish capital.

Under Carlo Ancelotti this season, Bale has made just three appearances for Real. Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol... ""This is an interesting story about Gareth Bale because obviously he is out of contract in the summer. He has always maintained he will stay at Real Madrid until the end of his deal, even though he may not be playing regularly. ""David Ornstein has written something in The Athletic about it today and it tallies exactly with some information we've had as well, which is that Bale is focussing on Wales and the World Cup this year. ""Of course Wales have got this big play-off coming up in March against Austria and then they will play Scotland or Ukraine if they get through the first tie. ""I think if Wales qualify for the World Cup then he's going to be without a club in the summer because his contract is set to expire at Real Madrid. So what I think he will then do is try to sign a short-term contract with a club back in the Premier League or the Championship. ""I actually think it is more likely that it could be a club in Wales in the Championship that he signs a short-term contract with. ""And if Wales don't qualify for the World Cup I think there is a very good chance that Bale will just retire from football when his contract runs out in the summer because he feels he's achieved everything he set out to achieve in the game and if he's not going to be able to play in the World Cup with Wales then he'll retire.""

Both Alexander-Arnold and Robertson were heavily involved in Sunday's epic 2-2 draw between Liverpool and Tottenham; both full-backs assisted goals, Robertson scored himself, and was also sent off for a hefty challenge on Emerson Royal. The pairing have been influential for Liverpool all season, and Neville feels mentioning them in the same breath as Brazilians Cafu and Roberto Carlos is justified. Speaking on his podcast after the game, Neville also explains why Antonio Conte's Spurs could strike fear into their top-four rivals, why Man City are like no other team in Europe, and whether there is pressure on Thomas Tuchel at Chelsea. ""Sometimes, during a game, you have to check yourself when you're involved in an emotional game like this as a co-commentator or commentator, you're mentioning them in the same breath as probably the two greatest full-backs I've ever seen, Roberto Carlos and Cafu. ""For so many years they were the shining example. They transformed full-back play. I know there had been attacking full-backs before, the Liverpool teams of the 70s, but when you think of them as being an attacker first, defender second, contributing to free-kicks, attacks, crosses, every part of the game. They made full-backs a prominent part of the team. ""They were exceptional, but these two... I don't think I've seen two full-backs play in the Premier League that are as good as these two as a pair. The way in which they combine on the pitch, the way they play the game, they're an absolute joy. Get Sky Sports Premier League table Live football on Sky Sports this week Premier League fixtures ""Robertson with his consistency does everything well. Defends well, he's competitive - slightly too much at the end - but he scored a goal and set up a goal. Alexander-Arnold is an absolute phenomenon when it comes to the quality of his passing, his delivery. It's something I've never seen before from a full-back. ""It's like De Bruyne, it's Beckham, it's Gerrard, and they're attacking players. He's playing at right-back, it's the highest accolade I could pay him. ""The contribution these two make is unbelievable. It's bizarre to me. I grew up saying let the full-back have it. You can't let these two have it. ""Conte knowingly let them have it, which was the beauty of the match, because it encouraged them forward thinking 'here we go I can win the game for my team'. But in Conte's mind, that was how he was going to win the game, to expose Liverpool's centre-backs.""

But that is a job that he has done before. At Ajax, they mocked his accent. He was a Tukker - a man from the east of the country, a region known for a down-to-earth approach. There were those in sophisticated Amsterdam who did not believe the great Ajax had anything to learn from him. They were wrong. Two domestic doubles and one kick away from a Champions League final later and there is an acceptance Ten Hag has brought some of the best football that Ajax has seen in years. His methods have delivered success, his manner has won over the doubters. The ascent to perhaps the biggest job in football might feel swift but his progress has been steady, methodically planned to maximise his skill-set. At 52, he has been a youth coach and a head of education, an assistant at home and abroad, and a manager at various levels. In a series of interviews with former team-mates, those who played with him as a teenager and were later captained by him, with players who he led to promotion in his first head coaching role, a picture emerges of an original thinker, a motivator and a disciplinarian. This is the making of Erik ten Hag. Raised in north Haaksbergen, a small town not far from the city of Enschede, life was idyllic in those early years. Jumpers for goalposts, football until dark. Ten Hag was good enough at it to shine when playing for Bon Boys, the local club where he is still a member. Get Sky Sports Transfer Centre LIVE! Premier League table Man Utd fixtures Leon ten Voorde, a childhood friend turned journalist remembers a cheerful boy and a rebellious teenager, not the strict disciplinarian obsessed with detail. But Ten Hag was captain of Bon Boys, nevertheless. Leadership was in his genes, according to Ten Voorde. Boudewijn Pahlplatz recalls it the same way. When Ten Hag was picked up by FC Twente, the biggest club in the region, Pahlplatz played alongside him for the youth team, the reserves and eventually the first team, across two different spells at Twente. ""After that, we even worked together when he was the head of education and I was a coach,"" Pahlplatz tells Sky Sports. They last spoke in the summer at a reunion to mark 20 years since Twente won the KNVB Cup for only the second time in their history. ""When I came back to Twente, I was not really fit any more because I had some problems with my muscles and Erik was the captain. He was an average player, but he was a good team player. Even when he was playing, he was already a coach, always knowing better."" In a team that included Netherlands international Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and those such as Pahlplatz who had enjoyed greater success at PSV Eindhoven, not everyone appreciated this central defender who was barking orders at them from the back. ""That was not always popular with the players because he was not the best player. When you are not the best player, it is hard for the better players to accept it. But he was thinking like a coach and the truth is that he always had the best tactical thoughts. ""Twenty years on, you can see that he was right all along."" The playing journey with Twente that had begun when they were teenagers ended for Pahlplatz and Ten Hag in 2002, but the latter moved seamlessly into a coaching role with the U17 side. He did that for a season before assuming control of the U19 group. There were early signs of his dedication. Wout Brama, now back at Twente but then an academy player, recalls wondering what they were up against when Ten Hag's first decision was to cut their holiday short by two weeks. Impact was quick. Progress was steady. ""He built his career very carefully,"" says Pahlplatz. 2002-2003: Twente U17 coach  2003-2006: Twente U19 coach  2006-2009: Twente assistant manager  2009-2012: PSV Eindhoven assistant manager  2012-2013: Go Ahead Eagles manager  2013-2015: Bayern Munich II manager  2015-2017: Utrecht manager  2017-2022: Ajax manager Ten Hag was later an assistant under Fred Rutten, then Steve McClaren, before following Rutten to PSV for three seasons. It was in the summer of 2012, aged 42 and after a decade of coaching, that he took his first head coaching job with Go Ahead Eagles. ""It has been step by step, developing his own philosophy and his own way of playing. That is very good. These days you see too many old players who immediately want to run a first team. That is very hard. You have to be so good that it is only for some players."" The opportunity at Eagles was not an obvious one. This was a club that had been relegated from the Eredivisie in 1996 and stayed in the second tier for the subsequent 16 seasons. Standards had slipped, expectations had dipped. Ten Hag soon changed that. Sjoerd Overgoor was not optimistic when he found out Ten Hag would be his new head coach. The young midfielder was trying to make his way in the game after being released by Twente as a teenager. One of the men responsible for that decision? Ten Hag. ""He had been the head of the youth academy at Twente when I was sent away and told that I was not good enough,"" Overgoor tells Sky Sports. ""I had a contract at Go Ahead Eagles so you can imagine how I felt when it was announced. But it went completely differently."" At the end of that season, there were celebrations on the pitch and in the stands as the club's 17-year wait to play in the Eredivisie would soon be at an end. Nobody there was in any doubt about the identity of the man who had been the main factor in that success. ""It was the most special day of my career,"" says Overgoor. ""I am not a great player, but because of Erik ten Hag I played in the highest division. He is the best coach that I have ever had. He was the reason. You don't see coaches that good in the second division."" Bart Vriends was part of the Eagles team, arriving on loan from Utrecht that winter to strengthen the defence. That season is fresh in his mind because he has been working on a documentary about it, the central figure interviewing team-mates - and Ten Hag. Every player tells him the same thing. ""What really came out from those conversations with everyone involved was that Erik ten Hag changed the professionalism at the club in just a couple of weeks at the start of pre-season,"" Vriends tells Sky Sports. ""This was a small mid-table second division club in a small city in the east. It grew into something else when he was in charge. He changed the mentality in the club. He changed the mentality of the players and the people who worked there. From day one, actually."" Ten Hag is fastidious. One of the first things he noticed was that the woman in charge of the kits at the club would bring out drinks and set them out on the table inside the dressing room. ""She would put the drinks there just randomly,"" says Vriends. This was a problem for Ten Hag. ""He wanted the drinks put out in straight lines. Everything had to be perfect in his eyes. People needed time to get used to that."" There are so many stories like this. ""We had one man whose job it was to look after the pitch,"" says Overgoor. ""Every day Erik would be coming to him and saying that the grass had to be two millimetres or something like that. That was a big difference for everyone at the club. He changed everything. ""Remember, this is not a big club in Holland. We did not have the best facilities but he made them the best. A lot of coaches come to clubs like Eagles and have the attitude that they have to deal with it. He did not deal with it. Instead, he made it better and better."" Detail was everything, as Overgoor found out in pre-season. ""We did a lot of ball work, but a few times in the afternoon we would have to run in the woods in groups. He would say that we had to run a certain distance in two minutes. We wanted to prove ourselves to him so our group did it in one minute and 50 seconds. ""He said, 'No. If I tell you to run for two minutes I don't want you to take two minutes and 10 seconds but I also don't want you to run for one minute and 50 seconds. Two minutes is two minutes. He was like that. If you did not stick to the plan you had a problem."" Some of the stories about Ten Hag make him sound like a tough taskmaster, but there was another side to his coaching. He was an innovator intent on raising standards. That meant placing demands on players, but also providing them with a better environment. Vriends had arrived from Utrecht. ""A bigger and more fashionable club back then."" But the attention to detail was still a surprise to him. ""He put beds in the dressing room so we could rest and sleep in between the two training sessions. That was really new at that time."" Video analysis helped take things to another level. ""It was the first time that I had experienced that. Remember, this was 10 years ago at Go Ahead Eagles. After matches, we would go to his room individually and be shown our clips. He was never satisfied."" One seemingly trivial example is cited by both of his former players, clearly leaving an impression. ""He put a window in his office door,"" remembers Overgoor. ""We were all saying to each other that he was doing that so he could see what we were doing."" Ten Hag later revealed the real reason. ""He said, 'No, if the door is closed and there is no window it is difficult to come in because maybe I am busy and people will not want to knock. Now people will see if I am free and that makes it easier to come in.' These were the details that he thought about. ""That was really impressive to me. It was something I had not seen before."" Vriends agrees. ""He had put this big glass window in just so that it made things more transparent, helping with communication. It is a little example of how he changed the thinking."" Ten Hag had to do more than change the thinking, he had to change the results. That process also began in pre-season but took rather longer to perfect. Before the wins started to come, there were hours and hours of work put in on the training ground. ""We played a lot of 11 against zero,"" recalls Overgoor. The team would line up as they would for a game but with no opposition in place, practising how they intended to move the ball around the pitch. It is a favourite of coaches but not too much fun for the players. ""Every time we would start with the goalkeeper and he would talk us through the patterns of how we could attack. He wanted diagonal balls. Every time that we played a straight ball he would stop us and make us do it again. He was very strict in terms of what he wanted. ""After four weeks of 11 against zero we were thinking, 'What is this? It is so boring.' But after a couple of months of the season, there were matches where we knew what we had to do and everyone was seeing it the same way. It was really clear and it was working."" By the time that Vriends arrived in January, Ten Hag had established his idea and the mood had changed. ""There were really interesting coaching sessions,"" he says. Overgoor agrees. ""We became confident in our style of play and it became better and better."" That style was 4-3-3. ""Like at Ajax,"" adds Overgoor. ""Sometimes he made changes at half-time but nothing weird. Maybe one midfielder had to come 10 metres deeper to gain more ball possession. That is his big quality. He knows how to change it to become better."" Perhaps influenced by having been released at Twente, Overgoor thought Ten Hag had a problem with him at first. ""He would shout at me,"" he recalls. ""I thought that he did not like me. Other players recognise it too and they said the same thing to me."" It took a conversation to clear the air. ""I asked him what I was doing wrong because he was always shouting at me. He told me that I was the sort of guy who was happy with 90 per cent but if I was angry I could give even more and would improve. ""Once he told me that, I knew that when he shouted he just wanted more. I had been negative but it turned into a positive. He believed in me but felt I had more to give."" Man-management was usually reserved for football matters. ""A lot of the time it is only about football, not about family or something else. Every day he wanted to talk about football and improve, improve, improve. But he knew what every player needed and that is a good thing to have as a coach."" Vriends remembers it the same way. ""I have not seen him a lot with a relaxed kind of vibe, up for a laugh or a chilled training session. He is always really serious. But I guess that is just the standard of top-level football. It took us a while to get into that. But it worked."" Harsh but fair is a mantra that wins respect in the dressing room. ""Every single player in that squad, even the ones on the bench, were really happy with him actually,"" adds Vriends. Pahlplatz also notes that ability to unite a squad. At Ajax, a club that has had its divisions in the past, the atmosphere among the group has rarely been a problem. ""He was always good with players. He always protects them. He can be hard with players but players are always very positive about him - even players who don't play or players who leave to go to another club. They all say he is a good coach and a good person."" Following promotion with Go Ahead Eagles, there was some frustration Ten Hag decided not to continue the journey with them in the Eredivisie and instead moved to Bayern Munich, taking their reserve team while Pep Guardiola coached the seniors. ""I was surprised and a little bit disappointed because I knew he would make me a better player,"" says Overgoor. ""But he was too good for us so it was normal that he would leave. It is the same with players. If they are too good, they leave. He was too good to stay. ""We were lucky because in the first year of the Eredivisie we had nine of the same 11 players, so in that first year without him we played exactly how Erik wanted us to play. That is why we stayed in the highest division that year, I think."" There is less surprise at the success that Ten Hag has enjoyed since. ""I knew he had it in him. We knew he was special. He went to Bayern Munich and then to Utrecht."" Vriends even played a part in him moving there. ""I remember the board at Utrecht contacted me because they wanted some information about this guy who they wanted as their new head coach. I was only positive about it. They took him and it was a massive success. It did not surprise me at all. ""I guess I should have been paid for that. I would be rich."" Ten Hag has had to evolve since those Go Ahead Eagles days. At Utrecht, he moved away from his 4-3-3 formation to utilise two strikers instead. It worked again. They finished fifth in his first season and fourth in his second - taking the club into Europe. ""I think he just adapts to the players that he has,"" says Vriends. ""We had wingers on the sides and played an attacking, dominant, passing game. At Utrecht, he changed formation to suit the players that he had. He did not really stick to this Dutch style of football."" At Ajax, he did return to that 4-3-3 formation but put his own twist on things - on and off the pitch. He had to convince a club, one with a very clear philosophy about how things should be done, that he had ideas of his own. It took time but that is what he did. ""At the beginning there too, people needed to get used to him,"" says Vriends. ""He was this serious man from the east of the country with this funny accent. It did not really seem to fit with Ajax at first. But within weeks it was all good. He changed the mentality. ""I think he actually changed the standards at the club."" A recurring theme of Ten Hag's career has been proving people wrong. That will be a challenge at Manchester United for various reasons. Patience is a virtue but the Premier League is full of sinners. Will he be given the time? Even his admirers doubt that. ""If you have a board who do not have patience it could be done after a few months,"" says Overgoor. ""But the board trusted him at Utrecht and at Ajax and you see what happens next. It was the same at Eagles. It was up and down. After that, it was up, up and up. ""At Ajax, they had the patience. I don't know if Manchester United has that patience if the results do not come in the first few months because there is so much more going on. If he is given the time he will do the job. He has shown everywhere that he is good enough."" Those training-ground methods might be an issue, says Pahlplatz. ""He does a lot of repetition. That was almost a problem for him in the beginning at Utrecht and Ajax. He trained them very hard and very long to get his philosophy into the players. That takes hours. The Utrecht and Ajax players were not used to that. ""He brought a new philosophy and that was a struggle for him at first. He demands so much of the players. Afterwards, you can see that it pays off. At the beginning, to convince players of his ideas is difficult. But you see how he has Ajax playing now, it is unbelievable."" Overgoor does not expect those 11 versus zero sessions to be repeated. ""He had to do it with us because we were not as good and needed some patterns to build on. He does not make Dusan Tadic and Daley Blind do 11 versus zero, they have more freedom. ""I don't think he will be telling Cristiano Ronaldo what to do."" That thought is a reminder that Manchester United is different. Pahlplatz remembers his conversations with McClaren at Twente. ""He used to tell us how it was with the media there. It is 24 hours a day at Manchester United. It is something you have to get used to. ""There are only a few Dutch coaches who have been at the biggest clubs in the world like Manchester United. Louis van Gaal was there, Leo Beenhakker and Guus Hiddink at Real Madrid, Johan Cruyff and Ronald Koeman at Barcelona. This is the level we are talking. ""He knows German football. He knows Dutch football. How will he cope with English football and all that comes with it? ""That is the interesting question. Will he deal with it?"" Pros:  Attractive football that players understand  Tactically smart  Not afraid to push young talent  Good relationship with players   Cons:  Does not love the limelight  Man Utd is a commercially huge club  Will he stick to 4-3-3? Premier League demands flexibility Fresh from spending an hour with Ten Hag reminiscing about their time together at Go Ahead Eagles, Vriends is convinced his old boss will adapt, just as he has to every previous challenge. ""I sound like his agent but I think this is a really wise choice by Manchester United to go for him. It seems like a tough club to manage but I do think it is a wise decision. ""His success has not surprised me at all. He is still the best manager that I have seen in my career and he has taken every step since then. For me, that season together was huge. One to remember. For him, it was just the beginning of his coaching career."" It was the making of Erik ten Hag. Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

The deal is expected to be on an initial three-year basis, with the club having the option to enforce an additional 12 months. Sky Sports News reported on March 31 that Ten Hag was in pole position to land the job over Mauricio Pochettino, with sources close to the manager and Ajax revealing compensation - understood to be below £2m - and how to handle an announcement had already been discussed at this point. United want to be sensitive to the Dutch side's showdown against PSV Eindhoven in the KNVB Cup final on April 17 and the fact they are in a tight title race. Ajax do not want the speculation to drag on, however, as it is still proving to be a distraction. They have batted away requests from English journalists and have not been issuing access to press conferences to prevent questions on the manager's future. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player United maintain that a deal is not done, but Sky Sports News ascertained last week that only the formalities were outstanding with all the major details agreed in principle. The make-up of Ten Hag's coaching staff at Old Trafford still needs to be set in concrete, but neither party has concerns over that process. The making of Erik ten Hag What must Ten Hag solve at Man Utd? Man Utd fixtures Premier League table Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Sports Ajax have been helpful rather than a hindrance in getting an agreement over the line, with the club invested in not blocking the advancement of their managers and players. Sky Sports News' senior reporter Melissa Reddy: ""Manchester United's interest in Erik ten Hag will come as no surprise given his status as one of the most progressive coaches in Europe, and his long links to their managerial vacancy. ""The 52-year-old has had admirers at Old Trafford stretching back to 2018/19, when his Ajax side knocked out Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, before then stunning Juventus and only being denied a place in the final after Lucas Moura's last-minute goal for Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham. ""Ten Hag is a popular choice to take charge at Old Trafford and represents what is seen as a ""fresh, exciting future"", although there is an acceptance risk involved as it would be a sizeable leap for him. ""The last highly-successful Ajax coach to move to England's top flight - via Inter - was Frank de Boer, who lasted just 77 days at Crystal Palace. ""The expectations, global glare placed on United, and level of competition at the top end of the Premier League is like nothing he would have previously experienced."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Gary Neville: ""Ten Hag worked in Bayern Munich when Pep Guardiola was there. We know the impact that had. He's won a couple of titles and cups in Holland. His style of play is good. He's got more experience than I think most people think at the age of 52. ""It's a massive jump but he's got a good coaching pedigree. He's not scarred and that's a good thing - he comes in fresh. I did a poll the other week and I was absolutely stunned - 240,000 people voted and 82 per cent were in favour of bringing him in over (Mauricio) Pochettino. ""I knew that he would be favourite because you can smell it on social media. I think Manchester United fans are demanding a fresh start and a fresh name. They want something that's completely different that they've not had before, and that's probably gone against Pochettino in some ways."" Sky Sports' Adam Bate: ""Erik ten Hag will go to Manchester United as an outsider tasked with implementing cultural change at one of the world's most famous clubs. But that is a job that he has done before. ""At Ajax, they mocked his accent. He was a Tukker - a man from the east of the country, a region known for a down-to-earth approach. There were those in sophisticated Amsterdam who did not believe the great Ajax had anything to learn from him. They were wrong. ""Two domestic doubles and one kick away from a Champions League final later and there is an acceptance Ten Hag has brought some of the best football that Ajax has seen in years. His methods have delivered success, his manner has won over the doubters."" Ten Hag's coaching journey from Twente to Ajax via Go Ahead Eagles explained in-depth by those who were there from the start...

Kevin De Bruyne fired the champions into a fifth-minute lead at the Etihad Stadium but Diogo Jota levelled eight minutes later for the second-placed Reds. Gabriel Jesus restored City's advantage before the break but Sadio Mane marked his 30th birthday with a second equaliser for Jurgen Klopp's men. Raheem Sterling thought he had put City ahead for a third time against his former club but VAR ruled against him in a tight offside decision and substitute Riyad Mahrez hit the post late on. The result ended Liverpool's 10-match winning league run and left City a point clear with just seven games of the season remaining. City retain their one-point lead at the summit, and Klopp told Sky Sports: ""It was like a boxing fight. You have your arms down for a second and get a massive knock and you shake a little. ""I liked a lot of things. I thought we were closer than ever. The second half start was much better. City really tried obviously things like balls in behind. It makes sense when you have these smart runs. In moments when we tried to breathe a little bit another one comes. It was a great game and the result, we have to live with and can live with. Man City-Liverpool ratings: KDB shines Man City 2-2 Liverpool - Match report and highlights Premier League table Get Sky Sports ""We could do better but in a lot of moments, we did really well. The intensity of the game is crazy. It was good fun, I liked it."" On what he said to his players at half-time, Klopp added: ""We showed [our] goal because it was a really good football situation which if we did more we would have chances. I was convinced we could win this game. They were much more direct than us today. They had a more direct idea than us and we wanted to let them run when in possession. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""Defensively we were sometimes in a rush, they put us under pressure and we can defend these situations better. The second half was really intense, they needed breaks as well, but their counter-attacks are not bad. Their decision making is really good and they always pick the right player. ""I think it is a completely fine and deserved draw. We wanted to make sure they see my boys are exceptional as well. ""Seven games to go for both teams and we will not stop chasing now that's for sure. Let's make sure we are ready for Benfica, for this team at Wembley [in the FA Cup semi-final] and then we will see who will have the better finish."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Manchester boss Pep Guardiola: ""He [Klopp] likes these punching games. It was a fantastic advert for the Premier League. Both teams wanted to win. I had the feeling we left them alive but Liverpool are a joy to watch, I know how good and difficult they are. ""We performed really, really well. I'm so proud of the team. Now we have seven games left and we have to win all of them or it will be over. ""I said before the game it doesn't matter if we win or lose. Of course, it was a massive game but we know what we have to do. Seven games is a lot of games, tough games away - so do they. ""I don't know what is going to happen if we win the Premier League but to be there for the fifth season - and I want to win the Premier League - is so good that is doesn't matter [if we lose the title]."" On Klopp, Guardiola added: ""He makes me a better manager. His teams are positive and aggressive in attack. I try to imitate him in that sense. We aren't friends, we don't have dinner together, I have his telephone number but I don't call him but I have a lot of respect for him and he knows. And next Saturday I will try to beat him."" The much-hyped contest lived up to expectations with the game starting at a ferocious pace and hardly relenting. City were the first to hit their stride with Jesus teeing up Sterling for a glorious chance inside the opening minutes - and after Jesus had re-established City's lead, there was a period when - to use boxing parlance - Liverpool were on the ropes. But just 47 seconds of the second half had elapsed when Salah played in his fellow forward and Mane made no mistake. Jamie Carragher told Sky Sports: ""It took more courage from Liverpool because Manchester City are such a special team technically. We've not seen anyone like them in our league. Every other team in the Premier League when they play Man City, they drop off and they hope for a goal on the counter-attack. ""Liverpool are the only team who try to take them on at their own game - and they're good enough to do that."" ""The performance from Liverpool not so much in terms of quality but their mentality to come out in the second half. They'd been given the run around in the first half. ""I don't think they did anything completely different. They didn't change. These teams believe in what they do and rightly so. To come out in the second half and match City, maybe do better, I was so impressed with both sides today."" Gary Neville added: ""Liverpool showed guts to come back into the game as City in the first half could've been out of sight. They keep coming back and the best teams have that ability, character and personality trait. ""Well done to Liverpool as City were exceptional in the first half. There was quality but it was frantic at times. You could see at the end when they were bringing each other down, they were panicking a little bit thinking about the counter-attack. ""But they are exceptional teams. What I admire most about them is from a defensive point of view. I don't know how they do it. They push high up the pitch with 10 minutes to go. ""The nerve to do that against the best in the world with the best passers and best runners is unbelievable. We've seen the best teams push up in the past but never like these two teams do in the game today."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports Jamie Carragher: ""I think Jurgen Klopp will be satisfied. Before the game, obviously he'd have wanted three points but the second half showed how they got back into the game having been 2-1 down. They'll be delighted with a point as Liverpool weren't at the races in the first half. ""They deserve credit for how they responded."" Sky Sports' Micah Richards: ""City are still ahead and they can take confidence from that. If Liverpool would've won today it would've been a rough road to the end of the season but it was a great game of football between two of the best teams I've ever seen. ""This and the reverse fixture in November, I don't think I've seen two matches with such a high quality of football. The players are breath-taking and the managers are on top of their game. Great spectacles. ""Looking at the fixtures, Liverpool have the harder run-in but Jurgen Klopp will be approaching every game one at a time. It is going to be tough no matter what. I thought City were outstanding today The levels of fitness, quality, decision making. I thought City had the better chances. In that first half, I thought City had more than Liverpool."" Sky Sports' Roy Keane: ""We're in the same place as we were before! We just saw great desire and fighting spirit from both teams. All the talk before the game from the managers was that this wouldn't be a decisive game but they both played like it was. ""It was like a final. City had the chance to win it at the end but I think a draw is a fair result. ""What impressed me about these quality players was the desire was still there to go and win the game right until the end. No team was ever going to dominate for long spells because there's so much quality on both sides. ""Liverpool struggled to get going but in the second half, they showed their character. Klopp had a go at them at half-time and they were early out onto the pitch for the start of the season period. ""He wanted them to show their true colours and we saw that before City again some great chances. It was a great reminder of what the game is all about and why we love it. Credit to all the players."" Sky Sports Gary Neville: ""Before the game, I thought a point would be better for City, but at half-time, the game could have been out of sight. The response from Liverpool in the second half was exceptional after being so poor, so below the standard in the first half. I always remember playing under Sir Alex Ferguson, if we played badly in the first half of a big game at the end of the season he would ask if we'd fought all season to play like that. ""It was almost as if at half-time Jurgen Klopp had to say, 'come on, we've built this team for three or four years and yet you've shown no authority, you've frozen, you've defended poorly'. ""I have to say, Liverpool responded brilliantly, and at the end of the game, considering where they were at half-time [it was a better point for Liverpool]. ""But City could have won the title today had they won the game; I don't think Liverpool could have because they have harder remaining games. But things move on, it wouldn't surprise me if both teams won every game until the end of the season and Liverpool are sat thinking 'I wish we played better in the first half?' But we don't know, there is still a long way to go. ""It was frenetic. Punch for punch. Some of the football we watched were exceptional, they put pressure on each other. Their defences pushed up so high. They stay true to their manager's principles, and they don't wilt. Liverpool have got real guts, they are streetfighters. ""What we saw in that second half was just the energy, passion, spirit, and fight that we have seen from Liverpool to come back. But City are a brilliant team, you can't really speak highly enough, there are no more words for these two in terms what they have achieved over the last few years. And they are going to go it in these last few weeks, hell for leather in the FA Cup, Champions League and Premier League."" Sky Sports Gary Neville: ""It's an unbelievable rivalry - 338 versus 337 points. In terms of consistency, quality, and excellence, this has a case to be the greatest Premier League rivalry of all time. ""But when I think about rivalries, I think there has got to be more to it than that. Is there ferocity, intensity, a story to tell. When people talk of the Sir Alex Ferguson-Arsene Wenger rivalry there were incidents and stories to tell - the tunnel incident at Highbury, the FA Cup semi-final with Ryan Giggs' celebration, the Marc Overmars goal at Old Trafford that wins the title. ""There were big moments between the two teams along with ferocity, fights, pizzas! There was more than just football excellence, so I don't think this Manchester City and Liverpool rivalry beats that yet. There were too many hugs - they like each other too much! I'm only joking, of course, but whether this will be a documentary in 25 years I'm not too sure. But in terms of excellence and consistency, it is an excellent rivalry. ""I admire what they are doing, it is absolutely brilliant, and the performance levels are high. You want to see this season go right to the death, you want to see both teams in the Champions League final, because when you think about the two best teams in Europe at this moment in time, it's these two competing in the Premier League, the FA Cup, and hopefully in the Champions League, they deserve it. ""They really are out of this world, but in different ways. Guardiola in a transformational way for what he has achieved, his type of football, and the influence he has had on the game. And Jurgen Klopp for his spirit and passion, pure football streetfighter. ""I see more of myself in Klopp than Guardiola, I don't think I could play in this City team, I wasn't technically gifted enough. But you can see characters like Jordan Henderson and James Milner who play for Liverpool with fight and spirit, while City are just a thing of beauty. Other than the fact they are the teams I dislike the most you have huge admiration and respect for them because you cannot help but like what you watch when you see them.""
