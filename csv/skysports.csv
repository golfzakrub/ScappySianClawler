Kevin De Bruyne fired the champions into a fifth-minute lead at the Etihad Stadium but Diogo Jota levelled eight minutes later for the second-placed Reds. Gabriel Jesus restored City's advantage before the break but Sadio Mane marked his 30th birthday with a second equaliser for Jurgen Klopp's men. Raheem Sterling thought he had put City ahead for a third time against his former club but VAR ruled against him in a tight offside decision and substitute Riyad Mahrez hit the post late on. The result ended Liverpool's 10-match winning league run and left City a point clear with just seven games of the season remaining. City retain their one-point lead at the summit, and Klopp told Sky Sports: ""It was like a boxing fight. You have your arms down for a second and get a massive knock and you shake a little. ""I liked a lot of things. I thought we were closer than ever. The second half start was much better. City really tried obviously things like balls in behind. It makes sense when you have these smart runs. In moments when we tried to breathe a little bit another one comes. It was a great game and the result, we have to live with and can live with.

The intensity of the game is crazy. It was good fun, I liked it."" On what he said to his players at half-time, Klopp added: ""We showed [our] goal because it was a really good football situation which if we did more we would have chances. I was convinced we could win this game. They were much more direct than us today. They had a more direct idea than us and we wanted to let them run when in possession.

The second half was really intense, they needed breaks as well, but their counter-attacks are not bad. Their decision making is really good and they always pick the right player. ""I think it is a completely fine and deserved draw. We wanted to make sure they see my boys are exceptional as well. ""Seven games to go for both teams and we will not stop chasing now that's for sure. Let's make sure we are ready for Benfica, for this team at Wembley [in the FA Cup semi-final] and then we will see who will have the better finish."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Manchester boss Pep Guardiola: ""He [Klopp] likes these punching games. It was a fantastic advert for the Premier League. Both teams wanted to win. I had the feeling we left them alive but Liverpool are a joy to watch, I know how good and difficult they are. ""We performed really, really well. I'm so proud of the team. Now we have seven games left and we have to win all of them or it will be over. ""I said before the game it doesn't matter if we win or lose. Of course, it was a massive game but we know what we have to do. Seven games is a lot of games, tough games away - so do they. ""I don't know what is going to happen if we win the Premier League but to be there for the fifth season - and I want to win the Premier League - is so good that is doesn't matter [if we lose the title]."" On Klopp, Guardiola added: ""He makes me a better manager. His teams are positive and aggressive in attack. I try to imitate him in that sense. We aren't friends, we don't have dinner together, I have his telephone number but I don't call him but I have a lot of respect for him and he knows. And next Saturday I will try to beat him."" The much-hyped contest lived up to expectations with the game starting at a ferocious pace and hardly relenting. City were the first to hit their stride with Jesus teeing up Sterling for a glorious chance inside the opening minutes - and after Jesus had re-established City's lead, there was a period when - to use boxing parlance - Liverpool were on the ropes. But just 47 seconds of the second half had elapsed when Salah played in his fellow forward and Mane made no mistake. Jamie Carragher told Sky Sports: ""It took more courage from Liverpool because Manchester City are such a special team technically. We've not seen anyone like them in our league. Every other team in the Premier League when they play Man City, they drop off and they hope for a goal on the counter-attack. ""Liverpool are the only team who try to take them on at their own game - and they're good enough to do that."" ""The performance from Liverpool not so much in terms of quality but their mentality to come out in the second half. They'd been given the run around in the first half. ""I don't think they did anything completely different. They didn't change. These teams believe in what they do and rightly so. To come out in the second half and match City, maybe do better, I was so impressed with both sides today."" Gary Neville added: ""Liverpool showed guts to come back into the game as City in the first half could've been out of sight. They keep coming back and the best teams have that ability, character and personality trait. ""Well done to Liverpool as City were exceptional in the first half. There was quality but it was frantic at times. You could see at the end when they were bringing each other down, they were panicking a little bit thinking about the counter-attack. ""But they are exceptional teams. What I admire most about them is from a defensive point of view. I don't know how they do it. They push high up the pitch with 10 minutes to go. ""The nerve to do that against the best in the world with the best passers and best runners is unbelievable. We've seen the best teams push up in the past but never like these two teams do in the game today."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports Jamie Carragher: ""I think Jurgen Klopp will be satisfied. Before the game, obviously he'd have wanted three points but the second half showed how they got back into the game having been 2-1 down. They'll be delighted with a point as Liverpool weren't at the races in the first half. ""They deserve credit for how they responded."" Sky Sports' Micah Richards: ""City are still ahead and they can take confidence from that. If Liverpool would've won today it would've been a rough road to the end of the season but it was a great game of football between two of the best teams I've ever seen. ""This and the reverse fixture in November, I don't think I've seen two matches with such a high quality of football. The players are breath-taking and the managers are on top of their game. Great spectacles. ""Looking at the fixtures, Liverpool have the harder run-in but Jurgen Klopp will be approaching every game one at a time. It is going to be tough no matter what. I thought City were outstanding today The levels of fitness, quality, decision making. I thought City had the better chances. In that first half, I thought City had more than Liverpool."" Sky Sports' Roy Keane: ""We're in the same place as we were before! We just saw great desire and fighting spirit from both teams. All the talk before the game from the managers was that this wouldn't be a decisive game but they both played like it was. ""It was like a final. City had the chance to win it at the end but I think a draw is a fair result. ""What impressed me about these quality players was the desire was still there to go and win the game right until the end. No team was ever going to dominate for long spells because there's so much quality on both sides. ""Liverpool struggled to get going but in the second half, they showed their character. Klopp had a go at them at half-time and they were early out onto the pitch for the start of the season period. ""He wanted them to show their true colours and we saw that before City again some great chances. It was a great reminder of what the game is all about and why we love it.

Was left exposed for Liverpool's second. Brought back into the side but showed the best and worst of his game. In the first half, his electric recovery pace was put to good use to stop Salah and he was sharp to shut down a Robertson pass in the box. But at the start of the second half he got caught out of position for Mane's goal when there was no way back and another piece of poor positioning almost allowed Salah to find Jota for a third. Out of the team in the first half of the season, Stones is back now and, with Ruben Dias missing, provided a solid performance in City's backline on this big stage. Dealt well with the Liverpool threat in the first half and used his passing quality to instigate several City attacks in the second. Laporte is having an impressive season for City and a crucial sliding tackle on Jota just before half-time was another highlight. It would have been a certain penalty and perhaps a red if he'd got it wrong. Hit the post seconds later when he was rightly flagged offside from a free-kick but some top defending against Alexander-Arnold in the box and a block on a Salah shot after the break were reminders of where his strengths lie. An attacking force down the left for Man City and it was another example of his wonderful passing range for the hosts' second, bending the ball to the back post for Jesus. Before then he could have had an assist when De Bruyne shot into the side-netting and a goal of his own when his deflected effort hit a post. Made a sleepy start to the second half and was fortunate not to be punished, but overall another impressive display. Another classy performance from City's orchestrator. His quick free-kick got them moving for the first goal after his early pass led to a good chance for Sterling. He had the most touches for City in the first half, none more stylish than the couple he used for kick-ups in his own half to spin away from Henderson. Get NOW to stream big moments Get Sky Sports Premier League table Watch Premier League highlights Covered a lot of ground in the centre of the park against an energetic Liverpool midfield but a moment when precise control was required let him down, with his header from a set-piece across goal to Stones miscued and a simple tap-in opportunity missed. But did his main tasks with distinction, as usual. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A performance which reminded everyone - if they needed - why he is so highly rated. City's star man stepped up and delivered inside five minutes when his deflected strike flew in off a post to get the defending champions going. He had his head in his hands on the half-hour when he hit the side netting, but repeatedly passed through the Liverpool lines and a tight offside call on Sterling and a Mahrez miss denied him an assist. Foden gave James Milner nightmares down the left flank at Anfield but he struggled to have the same kind of impact on Sunday up against Alexander-Arnold. As stylish on the ball as ever but when he did come inside the Liverpool right-back, Matip was there to shepherd him away from the danger zone. Was unable to create a clear chance. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A nearly-match for Sterling against his former club. He's been coming back into form and it felt like he'd have a say today but he squandered a one-on-one in the opening minutes and when he did convert from a similar chance in the second half he was flagged marginally offside. Subbed off for Mahrez with 15 to play and a feeling it wasn't quite his day. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Overthinking it? Pep Guardiola's surprise selection paid off in this one. Jesus, making his first Premier League start since New Year's Day, hit the net from Cancelo's excellent cross after a brilliantly-timed run got him in behind Alexander-Arnold. Before then he'd put a chance on a plate for Sterling and seen a penalty shout turned away after being upended by Alisson. Saw a goal-bound shot blocked by Van Dijk in the second half and got carried away shooting into the side-netting when better options were available, but an impressive return. What a chance to win it! What a miss! Released by De Bruyne in the final seconds, he got his shot/lob all wrong. And that came after his free-kick clipped a post. Almost the hero... Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Had one moment, twisting and turning in the box, but will be frustrated not to have got on earlier. The frustrating life of a goalkeeper: Alisson pulled off a brilliant save from Sterling inside five minutes from a one-on-one chance but 39 seconds later a wicked deflection gave him no hope with De Bruyne's opener. Could do little about Jesus' close-range finish for City's second, either. A touch of real quality teed up Jota for Liverpool's equaliser - another fine assist to add to his collection. And he thought he might score a goal to go down in history when he spotted Ederson off his line but his effort from halfway was miscued. Questions were asked about his defending when he was caught out by Jesus' run in behind for City's second, with Sky Sports' Roy Keane pointing at his body position, but was generally solid on the back foot. A reassuring presence in the Liverpool defence alongside Alexander-Arnold to help close down any threat from Foden or, late on, Grealish. His deflection gave Alisson no chance for the opener - could he have got out quicker to the City man? - but gave Liverpool a good base against this talented attacking team of Guardiola's. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A late booking for a cynical foul on De Bruyne blotted his copybook after what was an otherwise typically stylish centre-back display. Whether he was sweeping up a Walker cross aimed for Foden early on, blocking a Jesus goal-bound shot or snuffing out Sterling's run through on goal with pace, positioning and timing in the tackle, Van Dijk did it all with an air of calm which belied the occasion. Combined with Alexander-Arnold in the build-up to Jota's equaliser and booked for taking out De Bruyne on the touchline to sum up the blend of quality and bite he brings to this team. Another reliable display on the big stage from the Scotsman. Not at his best and at times off the pace. Made it too easy for De Bruyne to break into space and unleash his shot for City's opener, gave the ball away to Rodri whose own ricocheted effort went over, and beaten by Jesus in the box when his compatriot's shot was blocked by Van Dijk. Had to take out Silva when the City man got away from him and was perhaps fortunate not to see red. Lots of energy but finesse missing from Liverpool's captain. He played couple of balls over top in the first half as Liverpool struggled to grab control but eventually got it right just before the break, although Jota failed to make the most of it. Subbed in the second half. Had to wait 10 minutes for his first touch after City's dominant start but an outrageous switch of play to Alexander-Arnold in build-up to Liverpool's first goal got him going. Never one to back away from a fight, he was booked for chopping down De Bruyne in midfield was perhaps fortunate not to get another yellow when he caught the City man again after being tugged back by Rodri. Helped the Reds gain some control in that area of the pitch at points during the game. Came into the game with questions over his form and was hardly in the game in the first half but for one darting run past Laporte which was covered by Walker. But he showed his game is about more than just goals seconds into the second period, rolling a perfectly-weighted pass into Mane's path to make it 2-2. ""What a pass,"" said Gary Neville on co-commentary. A trademark left-foot curler was blocked by Laporte to extend his wait for an open-play goal but made his impact with that assist. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Jota has regularly been Liverpool's man for the big occasion and, starting ahead of the electric Luis Diaz, delivered again on Sunday, when he was perfectly placed and composed enough to slot in his 21st goal of the season. Barely had a kick after that - although he almost forced a mistake from Ederson - and made way on 70 minutes for Diaz when Liverpool were looking for some inspiration late on. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Like the rest of Liverpool's front three, Mane saw little of the ball in first half but needed less than a minute to make his mark at the start of the second, dashing in behind Walker to convert Salah's excellent pass. A nice way to mark his 30th birthday! On for final 20 minutes but unable to come up with a magic moment like the ones we've seen from him since his January arrival. On in the final stages for Henderson but wasn't able to give Liverpool's midfield the added thrust to come up with a dramatic winner. Sent on for the last six minutes but didn't get his big chance.

Footage, taken by @EvertonHub, shows Ronaldo lowering his right hand towards the ground before what appears to be a phone colliding with and bouncing up off the surface, as he exited the pitch following the 1-0 defeat at Goodison Park. Ronaldo has since apologised for the ""outburst"". The fan's mother has claimed he was left ""bruised"" by the incident, which left the youngster ""in complete shock"". Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Sarah Kelly said her 14-year-old son Jake Harding is autistic and ""didn't really digest what was happening"" until he got home. ""He's really upset about it, and it's completely put him off going to the game again,"" she told the paper. ""This is the first football game he's been to and this has happened."" Jake, she said, wasn't waving his phone in Ronaldo's face - and it was down by the floor when the Portuguese striker moved towards it. She also shared an image of her son's hand with the newspaper, in which it appeared red and bruised. De Gea slams Man Utd: Defeat a disgrace ​​​​​​​Everton 1-0 Man Utd - Match report Rangnick: Top four difficult now Man Utd fixtures Merseyside Police have now launched an investigation, a spokesperson confirmed. ""We can confirm that we are liaising with Manchester United Football Club and Everton FC following reports of an alleged assault at the Everton v Manchester United football match at Goodison,"" a statement read. ""As players were leaving the pitch at 2.30pm, it was reported that a boy was assaulted by one of the away team as they left the pitch. ""Inquiries are under way and officers are currently working with Everton Football Club to review CCTV footage and are carrying out extensive witness enquiries to establish if an offence has taken place. ""Anyone with information on this incident is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police Contact centre quoting reference number 228 of 9 April 2022."" Manchester United have confirmed they are aware of the matter. A club spokesperson said in a statement: ""We are aware of an alleged incident after today's game at Everton and the club will co-operate with any police inquiries."" The Football Association will also speak to Ronaldo, Manchester United and Everton to seek their observations over the incident. An FA spokesperson added: ""We are aware of the incident and will be seeking observations on the matter from both clubs and the player involved."" Ronaldo had earlier apologised for the incident on Instagram and invited the fan to a match at Old Trafford. He said on Instagram: ""It's never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing. Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game. ""I would like to apologise for my outburst and, if possible, I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship"" United are aware of the footage, which was widely shared and discussed on social media following the game. It was a bad day on the pitch for Ronaldo and Manchester United as Anthony Gordon's first-half goal gave the hosts three points. United, who have won just once in five Premier League games, now look unlikely to qualify for the Champions League next season. David de Gea described Manchester United's defeat to relegation-threatened Everton as ""a disgrace"" after their season reached a new low at Goodison Park. ""It's a disgrace from us, to be honest, we should win the game,"" De Gea told BT Sport. ""We don't create, that's the problem. We don't even create proper chances to score.

But that is a job that he has done before. At Ajax, they mocked his accent. He was a Tukker - a man from the east of the country, a region known for a down-to-earth approach. There were those in sophisticated Amsterdam who did not believe the great Ajax had anything to learn from him. They were wrong. Two domestic doubles and one kick away from a Champions League final later and there is an acceptance Ten Hag has brought some of the best football that Ajax has seen in years. His methods have delivered success, his manner has won over the doubters. The ascent to perhaps the biggest job in football might feel swift but his progress has been steady, methodically planned to maximise his skill-set. At 52, he has been a youth coach and a head of education, an assistant at home and abroad, and a manager at various levels. In a series of interviews with former team-mates, those who played with him as a teenager and were later captained by him, with players who he led to promotion in his first head coaching role, a picture emerges of an original thinker, a motivator and a disciplinarian. This is the making of Erik ten Hag. Raised in north Haaksbergen, a small town not far from the city of Enschede, life was idyllic in those early years. Jumpers for goalposts, football until dark. Ten Hag was good enough at it to shine when playing for Bon Boys, the local club where he is still a member. Get Sky Sports Transfer Centre LIVE! Premier League table Man Utd fixtures Leon ten Voorde, a childhood friend turned journalist remembers a cheerful boy and a rebellious teenager, not the strict disciplinarian obsessed with detail. But Ten Hag was captain of Bon Boys, nevertheless. Leadership was in his genes, according to Ten Voorde. Boudewijn Pahlplatz recalls it the same way. When Ten Hag was picked up by FC Twente, the biggest club in the region, Pahlplatz played alongside him for the youth team, the reserves and eventually the first team, across two different spells at Twente. ""After that, we even worked together when he was the head of education and I was a coach,"" Pahlplatz tells Sky Sports. They last spoke in the summer at a reunion to mark 20 years since Twente won the KNVB Cup for only the second time in their history. ""When I came back to Twente, I was not really fit any more because I had some problems with my muscles and Erik was the captain. He was an average player, but he was a good team player. Even when he was playing, he was already a coach, always knowing better."" In a team that included Netherlands international Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and those such as Pahlplatz who had enjoyed greater success at PSV Eindhoven, not everyone appreciated this central defender who was barking orders at them from the back. ""That was not always popular with the players because he was not the best player. When you are not the best player, it is hard for the better players to accept it. But he was thinking like a coach and the truth is that he always had the best tactical thoughts. ""Twenty years on, you can see that he was right all along."" 'He has built his career very carefully' The playing journey with Twente that had begun when they were teenagers ended for Pahlplatz and Ten Hag in 2002, but the latter moved seamlessly into a coaching role with the U17 side. He did that for a season before assuming control of the U19 group. There were early signs of his dedication. Wout Brama, now back at Twente but then an academy player, recalls wondering what they were up against when Ten Hag's first decision was to cut their holiday short by two weeks. Impact was quick. Progress was steady. ""He built his career very carefully,"" says Pahlplatz. 2002-2003: Twente U17 coach  2003-2006: Twente U19 coach  2006-2009: Twente assistant manager  2009-2012: PSV Eindhoven assistant manager  2012-2013: Go Ahead Eagles manager  2013-2015: Bayern Munich II manager  2015-2017: Utrecht manager  2017-2022: Ajax manager Ten Hag was later an assistant under Fred Rutten, then Steve McClaren, before following Rutten to PSV for three seasons. It was in the summer of 2012, aged 42 and after a decade of coaching, that he took his first head coaching job with Go Ahead Eagles. ""It has been step by step, developing his own philosophy and his own way of playing. That is very good. These days you see too many old players who immediately want to run a first team. That is very hard. You have to be so good that it is only for some players."" The opportunity at Eagles was not an obvious one. This was a club that had been relegated from the Eredivisie in 1996 and stayed in the second tier for the subsequent 16 seasons. Standards had slipped, expectations had dipped. Ten Hag soon changed that. Sjoerd Overgoor was not optimistic when he found out Ten Hag would be his new head coach. The young midfielder was trying to make his way in the game after being released by Twente as a teenager. One of the men responsible for that decision? Ten Hag. ""He had been the head of the youth academy at Twente when I was sent away and told that I was not good enough,"" Overgoor tells Sky Sports. ""I had a contract at Go Ahead Eagles so you can imagine how I felt when it was announced. But it went completely differently."" At the end of that season, there were celebrations on the pitch and in the stands as the club's 17-year wait to play in the Eredivisie would soon be at an end. Nobody there was in any doubt about the identity of the man who had been the main factor in that success. ""It was the most special day of my career,"" says Overgoor. ""I am not a great player, but because of Erik ten Hag I played in the highest division. He is the best coach that I have ever had. He was the reason. You don't see coaches that good in the second division."" Bart Vriends was part of the Eagles team, arriving on loan from Utrecht that winter to strengthen the defence. That season is fresh in his mind because he has been working on a documentary about it, the central figure interviewing team-mates - and Ten Hag. Every player tells him the same thing. ""What really came out from those conversations with everyone involved was that Erik ten Hag changed the professionalism at the club in just a couple of weeks at the start of pre-season,"" Vriends tells Sky Sports. ""This was a small mid-table second division club in a small city in the east. It grew into something else when he was in charge. He changed the mentality in the club. He changed the mentality of the players and the people who worked there. From day one, actually."" Ten Hag is fastidious. One of the first things he noticed was that the woman in charge of the kits at the club would bring out drinks and set them out on the table inside the dressing room. ""She would put the drinks there just randomly,"" says Vriends. This was a problem for Ten Hag. ""He wanted the drinks put out in straight lines. Everything had to be perfect in his eyes. People needed time to get used to that."" There are so many stories like this. ""We had one man whose job it was to look after the pitch,"" says Overgoor. ""Every day Erik would be coming to him and saying that the grass had to be two millimetres or something like that. That was a big difference for everyone at the club. He changed everything. ""Remember, this is not a big club in Holland. We did not have the best facilities but he made them the best. A lot of coaches come to clubs like Eagles and have the attitude that they have to deal with it. He did not deal with it. Instead, he made it better and better."" Detail was everything, as Overgoor found out in pre-season. ""We did a lot of ball work, but a few times in the afternoon we would have to run in the woods in groups. He would say that we had to run a certain distance in two minutes. We wanted to prove ourselves to him so our group did it in one minute and 50 seconds. ""He said, 'No. If I tell you to run for two minutes I don't want you to take two minutes and 10 seconds but I also don't want you to run for one minute and 50 seconds. Two minutes is two minutes. He was like that. If you did not stick to the plan you had a problem."" Some of the stories about Ten Hag make him sound like a tough taskmaster, but there was another side to his coaching. He was an innovator intent on raising standards. That meant placing demands on players, but also providing them with a better environment. Vriends had arrived from Utrecht. ""A bigger and more fashionable club back then."" But the attention to detail was still a surprise to him. ""He put beds in the dressing room so we could rest and sleep in between the two training sessions. That was really new at that time."" Video analysis helped take things to another level. ""It was the first time that I had experienced that. Remember, this was 10 years ago at Go Ahead Eagles. After matches, we would go to his room individually and be shown our clips. He was never satisfied."" One seemingly trivial example is cited by both of his former players, clearly leaving an impression. ""He put a window in his office door,"" remembers Overgoor. ""We were all saying to each other that he was doing that so he could see what we were doing."" Ten Hag later revealed the real reason. ""He said, 'No, if the door is closed and there is no window it is difficult to come in because maybe I am busy and people will not want to knock. Now people will see if I am free and that makes it easier to come in.' These were the details that he thought about. ""That was really impressive to me. It was something I had not seen before."" Vriends agrees. ""He had put this big glass window in just so that it made things more transparent, helping with communication. It is a little example of how he changed the thinking."" Ten Hag had to do more than change the thinking, he had to change the results. That process also began in pre-season but took rather longer to perfect. Before the wins started to come, there were hours and hours of work put in on the training ground. ""We played a lot of 11 against zero,"" recalls Overgoor. The team would line up as they would for a game but with no opposition in place, practising how they intended to move the ball around the pitch. It is a favourite of coaches but not too much fun for the players. ""Every time we would start with the goalkeeper and he would talk us through the patterns of how we could attack. He wanted diagonal balls. Every time that we played a straight ball he would stop us and make us do it again. He was very strict in terms of what he wanted. ""After four weeks of 11 against zero we were thinking, 'What is this? It is so boring.' But after a couple of months of the season, there were matches where we knew what we had to do and everyone was seeing it the same way. It was really clear and it was working."" By the time that Vriends arrived in January, Ten Hag had established his idea and the mood had changed. ""There were really interesting coaching sessions,"" he says. Overgoor agrees. ""We became confident in our style of play and it became better and better."" That style was 4-3-3. ""Like at Ajax,"" adds Overgoor. ""Sometimes he made changes at half-time but nothing weird. Maybe one midfielder had to come 10 metres deeper to gain more ball possession. That is his big quality. He knows how to change it to become better."" Perhaps influenced by having been released at Twente, Overgoor thought Ten Hag had a problem with him at first. ""He would shout at me,"" he recalls. ""I thought that he did not like me. Other players recognise it too and they said the same thing to me."" It took a conversation to clear the air. ""I asked him what I was doing wrong because he was always shouting at me. He told me that I was the sort of guy who was happy with 90 per cent but if I was angry I could give even more and would improve. ""Once he told me that, I knew that when he shouted he just wanted more. I had been negative but it turned into a positive. He believed in me but felt I had more to give."" Man-management was usually reserved for football matters. ""A lot of the time it is only about football, not about family or something else. Every day he wanted to talk about football and improve, improve, improve. But he knew what every player needed and that is a good thing to have as a coach."" Vriends remembers it the same way. ""I have not seen him a lot with a relaxed kind of vibe, up for a laugh or a chilled training session. He is always really serious. But I guess that is just the standard of top-level football. It took us a while to get into that. But it worked."" Harsh but fair is a mantra that wins respect in the dressing room. ""Every single player in that squad, even the ones on the bench, were really happy with him actually,"" adds Vriends. Pahlplatz also notes that ability to unite a squad. At Ajax, a club that has had its divisions in the past, the atmosphere among the group has rarely been a problem. ""He was always good with players. He always protects them. He can be hard with players but players are always very positive about him - even players who don't play or players who leave to go to another club. They all say he is a good coach and a good person."" Following promotion with Go Ahead Eagles, there was some frustration Ten Hag decided not to continue the journey with them in the Eredivisie and instead moved to Bayern Munich, taking their reserve team while Pep Guardiola coached the seniors. ""I was surprised and a little bit disappointed because I knew he would make me a better player,"" says Overgoor. ""But he was too good for us so it was normal that he would leave. It is the same with players. If they are too good, they leave. He was too good to stay. ""We were lucky because in the first year of the Eredivisie we had nine of the same 11 players, so in that first year without him we played exactly how Erik wanted us to play. That is why we stayed in the highest division that year, I think."" There is less surprise at the success that Ten Hag has enjoyed since. ""I knew he had it in him. We knew he was special. He went to Bayern Munich and then to Utrecht."" Vriends even played a part in him moving there. ""I remember the board at Utrecht contacted me because they wanted some information about this guy who they wanted as their new head coach. I was only positive about it. They took him and it was a massive success. It did not surprise me at all. ""I guess I should have been paid for that. I would be rich."" Ten Hag has had to evolve since those Go Ahead Eagles days. At Utrecht, he moved away from his 4-3-3 formation to utilise two strikers instead. It worked again. They finished fifth in his first season and fourth in his second - taking the club into Europe. ""I think he just adapts to the players that he has,"" says Vriends. ""We had wingers on the sides and played an attacking, dominant, passing game. At Utrecht, he changed formation to suit the players that he had. He did not really stick to this Dutch style of football."" At Ajax, he did return to that 4-3-3 formation but put his own twist on things - on and off the pitch. He had to convince a club, one with a very clear philosophy about how things should be done, that he had ideas of his own. It took time but that is what he did. ""At the beginning there too, people needed to get used to him,"" says Vriends. ""He was this serious man from the east of the country with this funny accent. It did not really seem to fit with Ajax at first. But within weeks it was all good. He changed the mentality. ""I think he actually changed the standards at the club."" A recurring theme of Ten Hag's career has been proving people wrong. That will be a challenge at Manchester United for various reasons. Patience is a virtue but the Premier League is full of sinners. Will he be given the time? Even his admirers doubt that. ""If you have a board who do not have patience it could be done after a few months,"" says Overgoor. ""But the board trusted him at Utrecht and at Ajax and you see what happens next. It was the same at Eagles. It was up and down. After that, it was up, up and up. ""At Ajax, they had the patience. I don't know if Manchester United has that patience if the results do not come in the first few months because there is so much more going on. If he is given the time he will do the job. He has shown everywhere that he is good enough."" Those training-ground methods might be an issue, says Pahlplatz. ""He does a lot of repetition. That was almost a problem for him in the beginning at Utrecht and Ajax. He trained them very hard and very long to get his philosophy into the players. That takes hours. The Utrecht and Ajax players were not used to that. ""He brought a new philosophy and that was a struggle for him at first. He demands so much of the players. Afterwards, you can see that it pays off. At the beginning, to convince players of his ideas is difficult. But you see how he has Ajax playing now, it is unbelievable."" Overgoor does not expect those 11 versus zero sessions to be repeated. ""He had to do it with us because we were not as good and needed some patterns to build on. He does not make Dusan Tadic and Daley Blind do 11 versus zero, they have more freedom. ""I don't think he will be telling Cristiano Ronaldo what to do."" That thought is a reminder that Manchester United is different. Pahlplatz remembers his conversations with McClaren at Twente. ""He used to tell us how it was with the media there. It is 24 hours a day at Manchester United. It is something you have to get used to. ""There are only a few Dutch coaches who have been at the biggest clubs in the world like Manchester United. Louis van Gaal was there, Leo Beenhakker and Guus Hiddink at Real Madrid, Johan Cruyff and Ronald Koeman at Barcelona. This is the level we are talking. ""He knows German football. He knows Dutch football. How will he cope with English football and all that comes with it? ""That is the interesting question. Will he deal with it?"" Pros:  Attractive football that players understand  Tactically smart  Not afraid to push young talent  Good relationship with players   Cons:  Does not love the limelight  Man Utd is a commercially huge club  Will he stick to 4-3-3? Premier League demands flexibility Fresh from spending an hour with Ten Hag reminiscing about their time together at Go Ahead Eagles, Vriends is convinced his old boss will adapt, just as he has to every previous challenge. ""I sound like his agent but I think this is a really wise choice by Manchester United to go for him. It seems like a tough club to manage but I do think it is a wise decision. ""His success has not surprised me at all. He is still the best manager that I have seen in my career and he has taken every step since then. For me, that season together was huge. One to remember. For him, it was just the beginning of his coaching career."" It was the making of Erik ten Hag. Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

Salah, whose contract expires in June 2023, is close to agreeing a new deal with the club to keep him until the end of his career. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says he is ""happy"" with the forward's contract talks which are being discussed between the ""decisive parties"", but speaking to Sky Sports' Geoff Shreeves ahead of Sunday's crucial Premier League clash with league leaders Manchester City, which is live on Sky Sports from 4pm (kick-off 4.30pm), Salah was not giving much away about his future at Anfield. The Egypt international described his ongoing contract talks as a ""sensitive situation"" but said now is not the time to be selfish and talk about his contract situation as he focuses on Liverpool's Premier League title run-in, and potentially winning four trophies come the end of the season. When asked about what he could say about his contract situation at Liverpool, he said: ""Well not much but honestly, but what I can say is there many things people don't know about it. ""I can't be selfish and talk about my situation. We are in the most important period for the team so I have to just talk about the team, focus on what is coming with the team and that is the most important thing. ""That is all I can say.

The Reds, who are on a run of 10 consecutive Premier League wins, have chipped away at the points deficit between them and City this year, slashing what looked like an unsurmountable14-point lead to just one point, and victory on Sunday would send Jurgen Klopp's side to the league summit. However, despite Liverpool's recent momentum, Salah thinks City still hold the advantage, especially with Sunday's game at the Etihad and also an easier run-in on paper. ""They are a point ahead and play at home,"" he said. ""I think that gives them more of an advantage. ""However, we are experienced players now and we've played together for four or five years. We know how to play big games. ""Hopefully we will win the next game but if you ask me about advantage, they have more of an advantage because they are a point ahead and are at home. He added: ""The most important thing for us is not to lose the game, but if we lose the gap is going to be bigger. ""The manager talked to us today and just said enjoy the moment and just go for it."" Mohamed Salah on his run of five games without a goal for club and country:   “I always look at this like the team has to win first then if you score it is going to be nicer, but if not, that doesn’t matter. The team has to win first and that is the most important thing because to win trophies the team has to win.   “For me, it doesn’t matter. If I can score that’d be nice but if not, it doesn’t matter really.""   When asked if he is bothered by his lack of goals in recent games, he added: “Zero. I don’t mind. I know I am going to score anyway. I’m still top scorer in the Premier League.   “The goals are going to come but the most important thing is the team winning. With the team winning, we just carry on.   “We need to win the Premier League and the Champions League. That is the biggest target for us as players and as a team.

We can't be in this situation and feel pressure. We just have to enjoy it and go for everything.""

The Arsenal boss had called for a reaction from his side after Monday's 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace but a 2-1 loss at home to Brighton saw them miss the chance to move up to fourth again. Later on Saturday, rivals Tottenham moved three points clear in the final Champions League qualifying spot with a 4-0 win at Aston Villa. The Gunners were once again below-par in the opening 45 minutes, trailing to Leandro Trossard's strike, and fell further behind after the break to Enock Mwepu's half-volley. It wasn't until Martin Odegaard's long-range deflected strike pulled one back in the 89th minute that Arsenal really stepped up the intensity but, as Arteta conceded, by then it was too late. Afterwards, he criticised his side's lack of reaction to Monday night and their inability to impose themselves on the match, particularly in the first half. ""The first half was really poor again,"" he said. ""The reaction that we wanted to show and everything we talked about we didn't make it happen on the pitch. ""We were sloppy with the ball, we were second best in a lot of situations, we didn't show any purpose or build any momentum in the game, we didn't play with the right speed and transform the game Brighton proposed today and the first chance - the only chance they had - they scored a goal. Arsenal 1-2 Brighton - Report & highlights Arsenal's fixtures Premier League table Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week ""We created a cold atmosphere we were uncomfortable with. When we tried to change it, it was great not to give up but it was too late. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""The fans were here and again they were exceptional. You can see the moment we gave them something… but we played a game that you could not see the purpose, the intention of what the team was trying to do. We didn't give them anything in the first half and that is down to us. ""It was not a problem of attitude, it was a problem of courage we showed to play and we didn't have that purpose. We didn't have that intention to attack and step in and provoke the situation we wanted to. We were looking at each other too many times instead of taking ownership and doing what we have to do. You can't play like that."" It was another ineffective performance from striker Alexandre Lacazette, who has failed to have a shot on target in any of the last four games, but Arteta insisted the Gunners' attacking problems were a ""collective issue"". However, he accepted the tactical change he'd made for the match, with Emile Smith Rowe in a slightly deeper role and the decision to field Granit Xhaka at left-back and drop the out-of-form Nuno Tavares hadn't worked as he'd hoped. ""The spaces we wanted to attack, it fitted Emile to play that position and because we thought the space would be there for Granit to use, which it was. But we didn't use it."" That change had been forced by an injury to Kieran Tierney, while Thomas Partey's absence in midfield is adding to Arteta's problems. With Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham to come in three of their next four games, Arsenal have a lot of work to do to make the Champions League spots, after looking favourites to finish in the top four a few weeks ago. Discussing the task ahead, Arteta said: ""With all the team available we knew how difficult the challenge was. Those two injuries make the situation more complicated. But we can't look at that because we can't be looking for excuses. What happened today is down to us, the players we have and the way we prepared the game. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""What happens next? We criticise ourselves a lot because we deserved to [lose] because we were really poor first half and lift ourselves up. ""We know this road is taking us nowhere, especially where we want to be. We have everything to play for in the last eight games. We have to have that level of energy and visualise the beautiful challenge we have ahead, don't sit back and let's see what happens."" Goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale admitted he was frustrated by Arsenal's inability to play with freedom, adding the performance was simply ""not good enough"". ""This was supposed to be the reaction game but it wasn't,"" he told Arsenal's official website. ""We've lost and not managed to pick up any points and next week is even bigger. I think we just need to go out there and be free and play our game, you know? ""It's a game of football and I think in the first half we were very tense and slow, so we just need to go out there next week, trust what the manager and the coaching staff are saying and go and play our football, which we've done all season. ""It's not good enough. Two games on the spin where the first 45 minutes has got away from us. You make it an uphill battle against any team in the Premier League if you're losing at half-time."" Sky Sports' Peter Smith: Only a couple of weeks ago it felt as though Arsenal were favourites to land fourth place and a long-awaited return to the Champions League. But in the space of six days their hopes of returning to Europe's top club competition have suffered a significant blow. The defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday Night Football was a bad one. Arsenal, harassed and harried by their London rivals, never got going and made costly mistakes. It was the worst performance they'd served up since the early weeks of the season. A young side is prone to inconsistency, though, and the real issue was not that loss but how they'd respond. The answer Arsenal fans saw on Saturday would have alarmed them. While Brighton didn't bring the same frantic pressing style to the Emirates that Palace showed at Selhurst Park, Arsenal were still slow out of the blocks again, sloppy in possession and disjointed in attack, with the forced reshuffle caused by Thomas Partey's absence and Nuno Tavares' form not working. Gabriel Martinelli was denied an equaliser by a marginal offside call on the stroke of half time but that would have been harsh on Brighton. It wasn't until Martin Odegaard made it 2-1 in the 89th minute that Arsenal showed the required intensity levels. With injuries, fixtures and points totals now counting against them, Arsenal have it all to do if they are to overhaul neighbours Tottenham in the race for fourth. Come the summer, they may look back on this week as the moment their encouraging season unravelled.

The United goalkeeper pulled no punches after seeing a deflected Anthony Gordon goal inflict his side's third defeat in five matches - a run which includes just one win - and further dent their top-four hopes. ""It's a disgrace from us, to be honest, we should win the game,"" De Gea told BT Sport. ""We don't create, that's the problem. We don't even create proper chances to score.

""If you don't score a single goal in 95 minutes we have to be disappointed. We had a good start and should have created more chances out of that domination. Then we concede a deflected shot and lost a bit of our composure. ""The second half we were trying to add creativity with substitutions but we didn't always take the right decision. ""We had to do something. We needed a goal and we decided to bring Mata and more verticality with Elanga. They were defending with their players in the last 35 minutes. We didn't find the right player at the right moment. We didn't have enough players in the box when we played crosses."" ""It's not only creativity. I think we had enough creative players on the pitch. It's also about being physical enough in the final third, being physical and trying to score a goal. We didn't have enough players in the box."" On United's top-four hopes, he added: ""It's difficult. As long as we don't win our own games it doesn't make sense to hope for good results from the other teams. ""Fred had some muscular problems on his hip flexor. We already are without McTominay. Without both defensive midfielders it isn't good for us."" The imminent announcement of Ten Hag could well be viewed as an unwanted distraction for Rangnick, but he said: ""I don't think this should be an excuse. We are Manchester United. We have lots of international players. There shouldn't be an alibi. There will be a new manager next season. If this is announced now or in 10 days it shouldn't have an impact."" Sky Sports' Ben Grounds at Goodison Park. This high-stakes clash was the polar opposite to the encounter between Liverpool and Manchester's other club this weekend. Man City vs Liverpool represents a meeting of two of the game's greatest minds, a masterpiece between the league's title protagonists in a class of their own. By contrast, Goodison Park hosted a festival of the doomed involving two clubs in desperate need of a reset. But Everton are not dead. This was a step in the right direction. It was this month three years ago that they produced arguably their best performance of the Farhad Moshiri era against Manchester United, outclassing them 4-0 to provoke a memorable rebuke from Gary Neville. The defeat exposed all the problems facing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. A fifth successive away defeat for the first time since 1981 would contribute to their failure to qualify for the Champions League. ""I've often said that clubs over the last seven years, if you've got weeds in the garden, then you've got to get rid of them,"" said Neville. ""But there's some Japanese knotweed at that football club and it's attacking the foundations of the house. It needs dealing with properly."" So much has changed and yet so much has stayed the same at United, who look no closer to competing for the big prizes.

""For this reason, I was pleased with attitude of the players, the composure. They decided to stay strong. And then in the second half, I think we won the game in an important way.

Son hat-trick as Spurs thrash Villa Tottenham's remaining fixtures How the teams lined up Match stats ""If you have an opposition who plays with high pressure, the space will open to attack. In the second half, we were much better I think because the intensity of Aston Villa was slower. ""It was a great win for us. Especially when you play a game after your rivals for a place in the Champions League - Wolverhampton, Manchester United and Arsenal - have lost. ""In this moment you start to feel the blood. It is important in this moment not to fail. We are working a lot on the mentality and the players are giving me satisfaction. ""For sure, to see this improvement makes me proud. It gives me great satisfaction. At the same time, I know we have to work on this improvement. ""Because there is not only the tactical, technical and physical aspects but there is the mentality.

Dejan Kulusevski raced through to score from another Kane assist and then turned provider for Son for the fourth goal. The Swede has been a revelation since his arrival. There is not much that Kane and Son lacked but he has added it. A natural left-footer, he knows when to slow the game down as well as speed it up, and that calmness in the final third sets him apart from the other contenders for that third position in the Tottenham attack. Gareth Bale's return to the club on loan from Real Madrid last season had briefly hinted at a dream team of a forward line - and the Welshman did deliver goals. But Kulusevski has been better. This time, it looks like it might be enough to carry Spurs into the Champions League places. Asked if Tottenham had the best front three in the Premier League, Aston Villa boss Steven Gerrard was complimentary but stopped short of agreeing. ""They are certainly high-level players. I'd say two of them are world-class and I think the young kid from Juventus, Kulusevski, is potentially a top player. ""That's my opinion on it, but I think you have to remember that there's City and Liverpool and Chelsea who've all got world-class players as well.

Arsenal's top-four bid over?,"This high-stakes clash was the polar opposite of the encounter between Liverpool and Manchester's other club this weekend. Man City vs Liverpool represents a meeting of two of the game's greatest minds, a masterpiece between the league's title protagonists in a class of their own. By contrast, Goodison Park hosted a festival of the doomed involving two clubs in desperate need of a reset. But Everton are not dead. This was a step in the right direction. It was this month three years ago that they produced arguably their best performance of the Farhad Moshiri era against Manchester United, outclassing them 4-0 to provoke a memorable rebuke from Gary Neville. The defeat exposed all the problems facing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. A fifth successive away defeat for the first time since 1981 would contribute to their failure to qualify for the Champions League. ""I've often said that clubs over the last seven years, if you've got weeds in the garden, then you've got to get rid of them,"" said Neville. ""But there's some Japanese knotweed at that football club and it's attacking the foundations of the house. It needs dealing with properly."" Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Premier League table Premier League fixtures So much has changed and yet so much has stayed the same at United, who look no closer to competing for the big prizes. Despite coming off in the 64th minute, Marcus Rashford attempted more shots at goal (3) and had more touches in the opposition's box (6) than any other player in the match. It is scant consolation for the disgruntled travelling fans but the forward looking a bit more like his old self is a small crumb of comfort that Rangnick can take with him back to Manchester.Ben Grounds Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Only a couple of weeks ago it felt as though Arsenal were favourites to land fourth place and a long-awaited return to the Champions League. But in the space of six days, their hopes of returning to Europe's top club competition have suffered a significant blow. The defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday Night Football was a bad one. Arsenal, harassed and harried by their London rivals, never got going and made costly mistakes. It was the worst performance they'd served up since the early weeks of the season. A young side is prone to inconsistency, though, and the real issue was not that loss but how they'd respond. The answer Arsenal fans saw on Saturday would have alarmed them. While Brighton didn't bring the same frantic pressing style to the Emirates that Palace showed at Selhurst Park, Arsenal were still slow out of the blocks again, sloppy in possession and disjointed in attack, with the forced reshuffle caused by Thomas Partey's absence and Nuno Tavares' form not working. Gabriel Martinelli was denied an equaliser by a marginal offside call on the stroke of half-time but that would have been harsh on Brighton. Arsenal laboured with the ball and lacked zip or a clear approach, as Mikel Arteta conceded afterwards. It wasn't until Martin Odegaard made it 2-1 in the 89th minute that Arsenal showed the required intensity levels. Twice this week Arsenal have passed up opportunities to go fourth. With injuries, fixtures and points totals now counting against them, Arsenal have it all to do if they are to now overhaul neighbours Tottenham. Come the summer, they may look back on this week as the moment their encouraging season unravelled.Peter Smith Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Heung-Min Son now has 17 Premier League goals this season and in this form might yet rival Mohamed Salah for the golden boot.

Marcos Alonso, Mason Mount and Timo Werner had all struck to quickly lay any concerns to rest having been stunned by Brentford 4-1 a week ago and then humbled 3-1 at home by Real Madrid. Thomas Tuchel made four changes from their Champions League quarter-final first-leg defeat with Mateo Kovacic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Timo Werner and Marcos Alonso all put into the team. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The switches helped Chelsea be more aggressive against a Southampton side known for their tenacity. It meant when Chelsea won the ball back quickly, they could counter-attack immediately and capitalise on the space in behind the Southampton defence. The Blues were so good at hustling the Saints midfield that the combative Oriol Romeu was hooked after just 35 minutes having been thoroughly overrun. Kovacic and Ngolo Kante were relentless in their pressure while Loftus-Cheek, despite playing out of position at right-wing back, played a crucial part in Chelsea's physicality, but also in attack by being involved in two goals. Alonso, too, also delivered the important opener with a trademark arrival into the box. Then there was Werner who showed his value after being benched against Madrid with two goals from enough chances to score five, not that it mattered in the end because Chelsea found their sting again.David Richardson Referee Jon Moss finally consented to the baying home crowd. Everton don't know how to win, according to Sean Dyche, but they found a way to hold on despite Manchester United's best efforts to go quietly. This is a poor United side and this abject display spearheaded by the anonymous Cristiano Ronaldo laid bare the size of the task facing Erik ten Hag if he is appointed. But the day and this occasion was about Everton. Richarlison, the tireless Brazilian, embodied Frank Lampard's calls for energy and fight for the cause in response to the second-half capitulation at Burnley. There were Herculean efforts by all those in blue, from Alex Iwobi and Fabián Delph - the unlikely couple - in midfield and of course from Gordon, who has the footballing world at his feet. Jordan Pickford was no bystander, playing his part to twice deny Marcus Rashford and then Ronaldo in stoppage time. This was a backs-to-the-wall performance from Everton, another twist at the bottom and another twist of the knife in United's Champions League hopes. ""I've got to give the lads a lot of credit here having lost twice in a week,"" Frank Lampard said. ""To go again Saturday morning against a team that's fresh and full of quality was excellent. It was joined-up with the fans, it's been good here since I've arrived by that's not a given. The players put the effort in. We've been due one of those, a deflection, something to hang onto. ""I'm pleased for Anthony. He feels it, he's grown up here and he's mature beyond his age. No wonder the fans love him. It's always a team effort and Jordan made two big saves in the first half and an outstanding one at the end. It felt outstanding. His quality makes the save. Jordan is England's No 1 for a reason and he absolutely showed it today."" ""We know it's in our hands, regardless of the others, to stay in the league. Some people around me have been calculating how many more points or wins we need but I'm not focused on that. We just need to keep performing like this."" The Spirit of the Blues plays out and they have never shown so much spirit this season.Ben Grounds ""He's a class act,"" Jamie Carragher said of Bruno Guimaraes after he produced a man-of-the-match display in Newcastle's 1-0 win over Wolves on Friday Night Football. The more the Brazilian plays, the more there is to admire about him. On his first home Premier League start for the Magpies since arriving from Lyon for £40m in January, the midfielder oozed quality from the first minute at St James' Park before he left the pitch to a standing ovation shortly before the final whistle. The 24-year-old's exquisite backheel volley against Southampton last month showed he possesses world-class attributes and he proved once again why Newcastle made him their most expensive signing so far under new ownership. Completing 37 of 41 passes, winning possession seven times and making four tackles, it was a dominant performance against a Wolves outfit who went into the game still with an outside chance of qualifying for next season's Champions League. Newcastle boss Eddie Howe told Sky Sports Guimaraes gives his side a ""different dimension"". His South American flair does exactly that, but he also has a strong work ethic and combative attitude. Despite last weekend's 5-1 defeat at Tottenham, Newcastle have been transformed under Howe and are now 10 points clear of the relegation zone. They are almost certain to become the first team to avoid the drop after failing to win any of their first 14 games. With safety almost secured, they can now afford to have one eye on building towards what they hope will be an exciting future. Guimaraes is certain to play a starring role.Dan Sansom Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Bruno Lage described Wolves' 1-0 defeat to Newcastle on Friday Night Football as an opportunity missed for his side in their push for European football and it is hard to disagree with him. It was an abysmal first-half display, which Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher said could only get better after the break, but there was minimal improvement in the second 45 minutes. Wolves' approach to sit back and soak up the Newcastle pressure worked for large parts of the first half, but they offered nothing going forward and failed to register a single shot on target until the 81st minute. The absences of Ruben Neves and Leander Dendoncker were sorely felt in midfield with teenager Luke Cundle, making just his second Premier League start, struggling to get to grips with the game as Newcastle's £40m January signing Bruno Guimaraes ran riot. It's a case of 'what if' again for Wolves fans, who will be wondering why their team failed to turn up at St James' Park when a win would have moved them to within two points of fourth-placed Tottenham and up to sixth, albeit momentarily.Zinny Boswell Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There was no sugar coating Roy Hodgson's assessment of Watford's survival hopes after their latest setback at the hands of Leeds. ""We have no reason to be confident,"" the former England boss said after watching his team succumb to a ninth successive Premier League defeat at Vicarage Road. The Hornets became the first Premier League side in a decade to match that unwanted record. The last team to do so, Wolves, were relegated, and it's becoming increasing difficult to see how Hodgson can turn things around and avoid what would be the first top-flight relegation of his illustrious career. As the unlikelihood of Watford hauling themselves out of the mess they find themselves in increases, so too does the improbability of Leeds surrendering the healthy position they have battled themselves into under Jesse Marsch. Three wins in a four-game unbeaten run have transformed the fortunes of the Yorkshire club, who were once staring at the plight now engulfing Watford. Marsch has galvanised a group of players many feared would struggle to adapt to methods other than those of predecessor Marcelo Bielsa. Such fears look incredibly misguided now, with Marsch having surely guided Leeds to another season in the Premier League.Jack Wilkinson Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

Sources from Ajax and the Dutchman's camp told Sky Sports News last week talks over compensation and how to handle a formal announcement had taken place, after he impressed in his interview. Ralf Rangnick believes United could have a rebuild within 18 months and with the club close to finalising the appointment of their new manager, Sky Sports takes a look at some of the key problem areas he must rectify... Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player This will be the burning question on everyone's lips whenever the Dutchman is confirmed as United's new manager and it will be intriguing to see what he does in regard to Ronaldo. The Portugal forward might be 37 now, but as he showed when scoring a sublime hat-trick in United's recent 3-2 win over Tottenham, he is still the club's most effective No 9. In fact, with Edinson Cavani, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood all failing to hit the mark up front for differing reasons this season, Ronaldo is actually the club's only real option in that position. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A healthy return of 18 goals and three assists in his 32 games in all competitions so far this campaign quite clearly demonstrate that fact, with the veteran easily United's top scorer, while his minutes-per-goal ratio also dwarfs that of his team-mates. Man Utd fixtures Get Sky Sports Premier League table How to watch Premier League highlights Yet, as Dutch football journalist Marcel van der Kraan told Sky Sports News, Ten Hag has stipulated he wants ""freedom with his management of players"" were he to take the role, so he can reshape the side and its style in his image, building it around younger and hungrier players. All of which could spell the end at Old Trafford for Ronaldo - who only signed a two-year deal to rejoin the club last August, with the option of an extra 12 months - especially if Ten Hag wants to get United playing more like the team in the blue half of the city.Richard Morgan Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There may have been a split in the hierarchy over the merits of appointing Ten Hag instead of Mauricio Pochettino but one area of recruitment that has been unanimously agreed upon is upgrading the midfield. It was a conundrum under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and interim boss Rangnick came no closer to solving the imbalance but with Paul Pogba set to depart this summer, that should at least remove one element to a central axis that has lacked the necessary tools to turn defence into attack. While Ten Hag is readily attainable given the modest sub-£2m compensation owed to Ajax, prising one of the club's long-term midfield targets is becoming more exorbitant with each passing day. Declan Rice has been described by former United boss David Moyes as ""England's best player this season"" with reports West Ham will only accept a bid of at least £150m. Senior reporter Melissa Reddy:   ""The midfield needs surgery and it's been an area that United have known for a long time needs proper investment. An elite midfield anchor is what they've been sorely lacking when you look at their rivals not just in England but around Europe.   ""When you look at the players they have in the No 6 position, United definitely need to strengthen there."" It was expected United would face competition from Chelsea, and while the ongoing uncertainty surrounding their financial plight could pave the way for a move to Old Trafford, they will not have a clear run at the coveted 23-year-old. Donny van de Beek enjoyed so much success under Ten Hag of course, and will return with a point to prove in the Premier League if not to his former manager when his loan spell at Everton ends in the summer. But it is Rice who could form the heartbeat of United's side for the next decade and heralding Ten Hag's reign with a record transfer and marquee signing would be a major signal of intent.Ben Grounds Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  When Manchester United finally signed Jadon Sancho last summer, the sight of him and Marcus Rashford dazzling on both wings was a mouth-watering prospect. Millions of United fans around the world believed the club had found two wide forwards fit to grace the Old Trafford pitch for the next decade. Seven months later, though, neither player was even selected by Gareth Southgate for his latest 25-man England squad. Rashford's omission was understandable, but Sancho's came as a surprise to many. Having started just four Premier League matches before the sacking of former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the 22-year-old has enjoyed a noticeable return to form under interim boss Ralf Rangnick. Before the last international break, Sancho had started six league games in five weeks, scoring twice and contributing three assists in that time. He also played the full 90 minutes of last weekend's 1-1 draw with Leicester. After an underwhelming start to his Old Trafford career, he has turned into a rare bright spark for United in what has been a disastrous season. Fifty goals in 137 games in four years at Borussia Dortmund, as well as twice being named in the Bundesliga team of the year, prompted United to spend £73m to secure his signature. With incoming manager Ten Hag's record of developing young players and the fact he is one of Europe's most progressive coaches, there is no doubt Sancho remains a huge part of the club's long-term future. It would not be a shock to see him as the main man the Dutchman builds his team around. As for Rashford, Ten Hag must decide whether to cash in or rejuvenate the career of a player who unquestionably still has world-class talent. His season hit a new low when he was named on the bench against Leicester despite the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani. It was described by Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville as a ""real killer and tells us Rangnick doesn't fancy him"". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A shoulder injury delayed the forward's start to this season but he has struggled to perform in recent months, scoring just twice since the end of October. With his current contract - which includes a one-year extension clause - expiring in 2023, reports he would consider his future at the club continue to circulate. At 24 years old, Rashford is already an experienced player for both club and country. Having amassed 298 appearances for United and 46 caps for England, scoring a total of 105 goals in the process, his ability is not the problem. He needs a new manager with fresh ideas, who is there for the long term and can rediscover the player who burst onto the scene as a fearless 18-year-old in 2016. Ten Hag is more than capable of doing that.Dan Sansom Erik ten Hag has not even been announced as Manchester United manager, yet already there is talk this squad of underachievers are split over whether he is the right man to take charge at Old Trafford. Much has been made of the undeniable step up in scrutiny the Dutchman will face when he makes the switch to Manchester, but his biggest challenge will be managing the egos in the dressing room. A lack of accountability on and off the pitch has seen these players let down Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and now Ralf Rangnick. For so long, the players have been given more power than the managers at United. That needs to change with Ten Hag. Sky Sports pundit Roy Keane, a former United captain, said in 2019 ""these are the same players that threw Mourinho under the bus, and they will do exactly the same to Ole"". The question for Ten Hag: how does he avoid that same fate? There has been talk of introducing an assistant to Ten Hag's backroom staff that has the United 'DNA'. Steve McClaren, former assistant to Sir Alex Ferguson in the 1999 treble-winning season, and Robin van Persie have been spoken about among others. It's an approach that all of those to follow Ferguson have tried to ill-effect. David Moyes had Phil Neville, Louis van Gaal had Ryan Giggs, Jose Mourinho had Michael Carrick, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had Mike Phelan, even Ralf Rangnick has Darren Fletcher. Such an appointment would likely help Ten Hag get to grips with English football and potentially improve relations with the dressing room. But it feels as though the lack of willingness to lead is an issue that runs deeper than positive feeling toward the manager. After all, for large parts of Solskjaer's reign, the suggestion was he had a happy squad. What Ten Hag needs to have control of the dressing room is the full backing of the board and the owners - just as Pep Guardiola has at Manchester City and Jurgen Klopp has at Liverpool. Whether those in charge at this moment can provide that is a different question. First step to proving it? Back Ten Hag fully in the transfer market. Sell the players he does not want and buy the players he does. This squad is in need of real surgery to compete with City and Liverpool - in terms of leadership, mentality and quality. As Keane said back in 2019, ""there's too many bluffers at this club to get United back to the very top"".Zinny Boswell Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Wayne Rooney had tipped Pochettino to become the next Manchester United manager, believing his Premier League experience and history of blooding youth placed him ahead of Ten Hag. ""I think Pochettino has done it in the Premier League,"" Rooney said. ""He knows the Premier League and at Tottenham he brought a lot of players through. He did it at Southampton as well. ""If I'm choosing from one of the two, that's who I'd choose. He would need to be given time to place his blueprint on the club and on the team. If you give him time, I think he'd do well.""

He is only 19 but the biggest clubs in the country have been vying for his signature for years. Long before lighting up the Championship with Fulham, Carvalho was causing what Greg Cruttwell, founder and chairman of Balham FC, his first club in England, describes as a ""circus"" of interest on the 3G pitches and concrete courts of south London. Manchester United flew representatives down from Manchester to meet him. Chelsea took him on a tour of their Cobham headquarters. There were meetings with Arsenal and, yes, Liverpool too. ""Every club under the sun,"" Cruttwell tells Sky Sports with a chuckle. Carvalho ""could have gone anywhere"", according to Cruttwell, but he and his family, who had moved to London from Lisbon only a few years earlier, turned down their more prestigious suitors in favour of a move to Fulham in 2015. It is fair to say the decision has paid off. Having excelled in Fulham's academy, the attacking midfielder is now flourishing at senior level. This season, he has scored seven goals and provided four assists in 18 appearances, helping put Fulham on course for promotion and put himself on the path to stardom. Carvalho now represents England at youth level but he barely even spoke a word of the language when he arrived in the country at the age of 10. For Cruttwell and Balham FC, it was not so much a case of them discovering Carvalho as Carvalho discovering them. ""He turned up at one of our U11 sessions on Clapham Common with his mum,"" recalls Cruttwell. ""They had moved over to London and were looking for a club for him. They weren't living locally, but somehow, they had heard something about Balham."" Transfer Centre LIVE! Premier League ins and outs Get Sky Sports Get NOW TV - save more than 25% Carvalho asked to join the session and his ability was obvious almost immediately. ""Within 30 seconds, one of us pinged him a ball 30 yards away, and he just pinged it straight back,"" says Cruttwell. ""Me and my other coach looked at each other and went, 'OK!' ""He struck it beautifully and he was amazing in the session. His poise, his balance and his level of skill were fantastic and he had that little bit of swagger too. At the end, we asked him to come back for more sessions. After that, we took him in and he did brilliantly."" Carvalho had been part of Benfica's academy back in Portugal but he embraced his new surroundings at Balham and impressed his coaches as much off the pitch as he did on it. ""Our squads very much represent the demographic of inner-London, so all kinds of creeds, cultures and backgrounds,"" says Cruttwell. ""Fabio fitted in brilliantly and, although he was obviously a class above, he never played on that and the other boys loved him. ""He didn't have a big-headed bone in his body. He was never like other kids who say, 'I'm going to make it in the Premier League, I'm going to do this or that.' ""Obviously, he had that ambition but he's the humblest kid and he has the X-factor, in terms of his personality. ""When he walks into a room, he lights it up. His smile, the way he slaps your hand. This is when he was only 10 or 11 years old and forever since. Even though he's now flying at Fulham, he still comes back and watches Balham games. He's just a top boy."" Carvalho spent three years at Balham but a move to a higher level soon became inevitable, the process accelerated by a memorable performance during a six-a-side tournament in Guildford. ""It was peeing down with rain and I was in the clubhouse sheltering,"" says Cruttwell. ""We were packed in there like sardines. You couldn't move. People didn't know I was from Balham, but I became aware of all these teenagers shouting, 'You've got to come and see this kid on pitch 12! Oh my God, he's unbelievable!' ""When the rain stopped, there was this mass exodus from the clubhouse to that pitch. I got there and Fabio was doing rabona crosses from out wide and all kinds of tricks. It was ridiculous. ""I had already been contacted by Fulham at that point but it was after that tournament that I started to get a lot of calls from Chelsea and other clubs and the whole academy circus started."" Carvalho had become hot property but he was unfazed by the attention and, crucially, unpressured by those close to him. ""I've seen thousands and thousands of parents trying to push their kids into things,"" says Cruttwell. ""The moment they think their kid has got a chance, they're on it. ""Fabio's parents weren't like that at all. It became clear that he was going to have to go to the next level but his parents were actually happy for him to be at Balham. They weren't pushing him. ""In fact, when we did the deal with Fulham, having met all those other clubs, they insisted he saw out the season with us because they were totally happy with his development here."" Their trust in Balham was such that they even asked Cruttwell and the club's goalkeeping coach Pedro Soares, a Portuguese-speaker, to help them with the decision-making process and lead negotiations on their behalf. ""They didn't speak much English so we were aware they could have been taken advantage of by other clubs but they were really good at seeing what was best for him in the long-term,"" says Cruttwell. ""Going into Chelsea was like taking him around Disneyland. Other clubs dangled every carrot possible. But Fabio's parents saw past that. They weren't star-struck. They saw that Fulham, which was also a category one academy, was the right place for him."" Colin Omogbehin, now Fulham's first-team development coach, played a key role in organising the move and Huw Jennings, the club's academy director at the time, was similarly influential. While the bigger clubs attempted to wow Carvalho, Omogbehin and Jennings focused on offering family support and mapping out a clear pathway for him from academy to first team. Their approach felt like a better fit for a player whose sole priority was to play. ""That's the key thing about Fabio - he just wants to play football,"" says Cruttwell. ""Obviously, he was excited by the interest he was getting, but I don't think he was that bothered about where he went. ""That's what some of the clubs got wrong. Fabio was just as interested in playing in a pick-up game in the park across the road as he was in training at Chelsea. He just wanted to play, whether it was in a cage in Stockwell or whatever."" Carvalho was given freedom to express himself at Balham and while the step up to professional football has brought greater physical and tactical demands, Fulham have been careful to ensure he retains the flair and spontaneity that make him so special. ""Fulham have done an excellent job with him,"" says Cruttwell, and it seems Liverpool agree. The club were willing to send him back to Craven Cottage on loan until the end of the season had they been able to complete the deal on Deadline Day. Fulham will be loathe to lose him - it is understood that the 19-year-old will move to Anfield this summer on a five-year contract - but at Balham there is pride at his achievements. ""It was fantastic for us to have him for three years and we feel we gave him a good grounding,"" says Cruttwell. ""He's only slight, but he's physical. As a number 10, he's got magic in his feet, but he's also a magical person. I see the same kid now as I did on Clapham Common and I see the same joy in playing. He must never lose that.""

Arsenal are a decent team - they've got good young players - but they're going to be up and down with their performances. One week they'll be a nine out of 10, the next week they'll be a four out of 10. It wouldn't have surprised me if they didn't beat Watford when they won 3-2, it wouldn't have surprised me if they didn't beat Leicester when they won 2-0 - that's just the way it is, it's a young team. There are ways of getting beat and Monday night at Palace wasn't a good way of getting beat. It was worrying. I expected one of those performances from Tottenham before the end of the season, I didn't expect it from Arsenal. They could lose a game, but not like that. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Palace is a hard place to go on a Monday night, don't underestimate it - and if Arsenal had beaten Palace, I thought top four was done and dusted. It would have been three points clear and a game in hand, it was massive. Now all of a sudden, Arsenal don't really have a game in hand - because Tottenham have got them at home anyway. It doesn't matter what they do with their game in hand, because Tottenham will have to beat them and can overtake them. You watch Tottenham completely and utterly dismantling Newcastle on Sunday. Newcastle aren't the worst team in the world.

Get Sky Sports Get NOW TV - save more than 25% Live football on Sky Sports this week How to watch Premier League highlights Spurs are the favourites for top four now. When Harry Kane's playing like he is, I don't think too many teams are going to beat them. I saw him go to the Etihad and rip Manchester City apart. I saw him rip West Ham apart, I saw him rip Newcastle apart. But you take Kane out of the team, top four ain't happening for Spurs. It's as simple as that. When he doesn't turn up at Burnley away, they get beaten. Tottenham are a one-man team and that's not being disrespectful. You could have a Ferrari, but without an engine in the car it ain't working. He's the all-round package, and that's why he's the best centre-forward in the world, and I've said it for a long, long time. Kieran Tierney is going to be a big miss for Arsenal, after his knee injury before the Palace game. He's one of the players you can't afford to take out of this Arsenal team. He's solid, he's an 8/10 every week, he sets an example. He's a winner - you know what you're going to get with him, and he was a big miss on Monday night. Nuno Tavares had one of them games at left-back, but it's hard when you're out of the team for so long. You're not really playing football - you're just training. Even playing in the U23s, it's not the Premier League. To come in and say: 'Right, play in this game' - you feel for these players. No matter how much you train, it's not the same as playing. I don't think Manchester United are totally out of the top-four race, but David de Gea had to make a world-class save [from Wesley Fofana] - a world, world-class save - to get them a draw against Leicester. The Arsenal result at Palace gives them a chance though. Arsenal and Tottenham have got to play each other, Man Utd have got to play Arsenal, and if results go their way then they are in it.

The Three Lions were drawn with the United States, Iran and one of Scotland, Wales or Ukraine in Friday's draw, with Southgate's men benefiting from being top seeds, earned by being ranked as one of the top seven international sides in the world. Speaking from Qatar, Neville believes the November 25 clash with the USA - England's second of the group - is the most difficult game in the opening round of matches for the Three Lions, but says the presence of Scottish or Welsh fans could make life difficult for the Euro 2020 finalists in the Gulf state. ""England would have wanted to avoid a home nation,"" Neville told Sky Sports News after the draw. ""I'm not sure Scotland and Wales would have wanted to avoid it but certainly England. It just brings that complication you don't need. They've always been difficult opponents. ""We know what it means to the Welsh and the Scottish to play against England. That's not being arrogant, it's just that we know it's a huge fixture. It is for England as well but it doesn't seem to carry that sort of dislike that comes with the Welsh or the Scottish fever towards England. ""And then relations at Government level between Iran, England and USA over the last 20 to 30 years have not always been great. So there will be a lot of interest around that game. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""Of course, the way in which USA will look at England will provide great difficulty.

""I'm looking forward to the group, they've all got a meaning to them but they are difficult games from an emotional perspective more than a football perspective. That does carry something of a problem for England."" Despite the difficult challenges in the group, Neville has backed the Three Lions to go all the way this winter, claiming the November to December structure of this year's competition will suit Southgate's squad. ""This is the best England team since 1966,"" the Sky Sports pundit added. ""They've achieved far more than any other team since. ""They're the best group of players, they're playing consistently well in tournaments, the level of football is good and they're still maturing. They're getting better, they've got great technical players, you can't not like them and the manager is fantastic. ""This is now a perfect tournament for England, whose teams over the last 30 or 40 years have always talked about being tired at the end of the season. We're coming over to Qatar in the November, December period - perfect conditions. ""England and Premier League players should be fresher than they have been in the past. And with this team, if they're growing like that, you hope they can go that step further [than Euro 2020]."" England will face Iran for the first time in international competition, but they will know their other two opponents much better when they face off in Qatar. The Three Lions faced the USA in their 2010 World Cup opener, drawing 1-1 at the South Africa tournament in a game forever remembered for Rob Green's error for the Americans' equaliser. England have faced one of Scotland and Wales in their last two European Championship campaigns, while Southgate's men dispatched Ukraine 4-0 at Euro 2020. Wales made it through to the World Cup play-off final earlier this month by beating Austria in Cardiff thanks to Gareth Bale's brace. The other two teams are due to play their play-off match to meet Rob Page's side in the final in June after their original fixture was postponed due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Reacting to England's opponents this winter, Southgate responded: ""The first two [Iran and USA] are obviously teams we've not played for quite a while and the third is a total unknown but obviously throws up a possible British derby, we know what they're all about, we've had plenty of them. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""When you're seeded you get the advantage of missing out on those big six or seven teams. I think for most of the first seeds they would be pleased with the first group they get. ""The USA is an interesting one. I know (head coach) Gregg Berhalter quite well, we've met a few times and had long chats about things, in fact only a couple of weeks ago. We were smiling at the end [of the draw] there. They've got some very good players and we know what they could be capable of as a nation. That one, in particular, is an intriguing game. ""In this situation all our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine, so when that tie is played and how that is played out is irrelevant really. It's for the rest of us to adapt and adjust and provide them with the opportunity to play as and when they are able to."" Meanwhile, Southgate says his England squad will need to quit their Premier League responsibilities ""as quickly as possible"" in November to head off to Qatar after being handed an opening-day World Cup tie. The Three Lions' game against Iran on November 21 comes just eight days after the Premier League stops for a winter break. Southgate claimed he is now happy with the clarity of the situation, but will call on his players to be swift in getting out of their club duties. ""We're in on day one so it's quite clear now what our programme looks like with the end of the Premier League season and getting out here as quickly as possible,"" Southgate told the BBC on Friday night. While England will start their World Cup campaign earlier than most of their rival teams, it does present the Three Lions with three days' rest before the round of 16 gets under way, should they top their group. ""It does but we've got to get out of the group,"" added Southgate in response to that point being made. ""What we've done well is we've approached these tournaments by looking at the group - the first objective is to get out of the group regardless of the opposition and then you build from there.""

The American family have been in charge at Old Trafford since 2005 but they have overseen just three major trophy wins - an FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League - in the nine years since Sir Alex Ferguson retired as manager. United's exit from the Champions League at the hands of Atletico Madrid in March means they are currently enduring their worst trophy drought in 40 years, while supporter opposition to the Glazers was increased by their ill-fated attempt to include the club in the European Super League last year. Neville admitted the Super League fiasco was a turning point in his relationship with United's owners, but he believes they can begin to get the fans back on side if they commit to a number of changes at the club - including building a new stadium. Speaking at a Sky Bet fan debate on The Overlap, Neville said: ""I'm really worried at this moment in time. I'd never gone for the Glazer family whilst I was at the club. I saw no reason to - we were successful. ""The Super League was a moment for me where all those owners demonstrated complete and utter greed and disdain for English football. They were willing to ruin it on behalf of their own interests. ""In terms of the Glazer family, post that Super League they said they were going to communicate, they said they were going to change things. They've not changed anything. Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Live football on Sky Sports this week How to watch Premier League highlights ""My view is there is a problem right at the very top. They've had 10 years to prove they can be good football operators beyond Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill (former chief executive), and they've proven they can't do it. ""The first thing that should happen is they should sell the club, because of the Super League, because of their 10 years of failure without Ferguson and that team that he had. But if they really want to stay - because you can never force the Glazer family to sell - then they've got to do four or five things. ""Number one, they've got to stop taking the dividends out of the club if they want to reset the culture. When the owners are pulling money out of the club at the expense of a successful team, it's a bad message from the very top. ""Number two, they've got to pay off that debt and they can do that by selling £500m worth of shares to the fans. They can then rebuild that stadium with a billion quid. It does probably need knocking down to be fair. ""That doesn't need renovation, it needs a new stadium, and that money can be funded from a 20-year contract with a sponsor at £60m, £70m a year. Call it 'something Old Trafford' and we have a brand new stadium that resets the culture of Manchester United, where we have the best stadium in the world. That needs to happen. ""They then need to build a new training ground. Me and Roy (Keane) were part of the squad when we moved 22 years ago. We were devastated to leave The Cliff, but we've now got a training ground that's behind the other training grounds. ""They then need to go and put £100m, £150m a year into a proper sporting project, along with those four things, and then you can say 'the Glazer family have reset the culture of the club'. The fans are on the edge again."" One of the most pressing issues currently occupying the Glazers is appointing a new manager to replace interim boss Ralf Rangnick, who will take a up a consultancy role at Old Trafford in the summer. Ajax boss Erik ten Hag has been interviewed and United are gathering information about the Dutchman, and Neville believes he is the preferred candidate of United's supporters. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""He worked in Bayern Munich when Pep Guardiola was there,"" Neville said. ""We know the impact that had. ""He's won a couple of titles and cups in Holland. His style of play is good. He's got more experience than I think most people think at the age of 52. It's a massive jump but he's got a good coaching pedigree. He's not scarred and that's a good thing - he comes in fresh. ""I did a poll the other day and I was absolutely stunned - 240,000 people voted and 82 per cent were in favour of bringing him in over (Mauricio) Pochettino. I knew that he would be favourite because you can smell it on social media.

""But nobody knows until somebody gets into the building and starts looking at the job that needs to be done. Obviously it's a huge disappointment with the season and there's an important month or two coming up with trying to get into the top four. ""But I've no doubt they'll bounce back. It might take a bit of time but every big club has little periods and United are going through one at the moment. The next manager they get in - it's stating the obvious - is huge.

Ahead of United's Premier League clash against Leicester City, live on Sky Sports, the Portuguese midfielder was handed a new four-year contract at Old Trafford, with the option of a further year. The improved terms come with the club still employing Ralf Rangnick as an interim manager while Ajax manager Erik Ten Hag has been interviewed for a permanent role from the summer. With confusion over who is helping to recruit new players at United as well, Merson has strongly criticised the decision to make big investments on players, without knowing whether the likes of Ten Hag or PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino - who has also been linked with the role - will like them. ""I'm flabbergasted,"" Merson told Soccer Saturday. ""You give him a four-year contract extension with more money, but a manager could come in and he might not like him.

Jack Grealish is a great player, but would Jurgen Klopp have paid £100m for him? It's horses for courses and a manager could come in and say that Fernandes is not my cup of tea."" Fernandes was the club's standout player during his first 18 months at Old Trafford, and has won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award twice The 27-year-old has made 117 appearances for United and scored 49 goals in all competitions since moving from Sporting. He also scored both goals for Portugal in midweek to secure his country's place at the 2022 World Cup, beating North Macedonia 2-0 in their play-off. United football director John Murtough added: ""Everyone is well aware of Bruno's importance to Manchester United. His goals and assists record is phenomenal and he has performed remarkably consistently since he joined the club. ""Bruno's work-rate, dedication and fantastic attitude are exactly what we want from a Manchester United player. He is the ultimate professional with many fantastic attributes to drive the high standards required to play for this great club. ""Bruno, like everyone across the football club, remains hugely ambitious and determined to deliver sustained success on the pitch to get us back to challenging for titles."" Analysis from Sky Sports News senior reporter Melissa Reddy: Of all the matters Manchester United need to work through, tying down Bruno Fernandes on a new contract with improved terms would be far down the list. The player's previous deal had three years to run with the option of a further 12 months, and the development purely revolves around financially rewarding him for his influence under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and underlining his status in the squad. It will be one less thing to tick off on United's long to-do list, but it was not pressing. With the identity of the next permanent manager still unknown - whether he would see Fernandes as core as the new contract would reflect will be intriguing given the midfielder's drop in form - and so many big question marks around the squad, the timing is odd. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  While progress is being made on the dugout front, with Erik ten Hag formally interviewed over taking charge of the club, United need to have more certainty in place over the make-up of the team. The attack and midfield need surgery, with the acceptance from the recruitment group that adding the right striker and anchor in the centre of the park is imperative. Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard, Edinson Cavani and Juan Mata may leave in the summer, while Marcus Rashford's future is uncertain. The England international's performances have been well below par, but while he can point to being played through injury as a semi-defence, Fernandes, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire have also been levels below expectation. What happens with loaned-out pair Anthony Martial and Donny van de Beek? Or Dean Henderson, Eric Bailly and Nemanja Matic? Then there is the Cristiano Ronaldo conundrum, as well as a clutch of deals that expire next summer. When held up against the greater scheme of things, the Fernandes development is a small one. Manchester United are suffering a tumultuous campaign after a second-place Premier League finish last season morphed into a severe decline in form - culminating with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer losing his job in November last year. Fernandes arrived at Old Trafford with a fanfare in January, 2020 and immediately delivered with league-topping attacking returns and talismanic displays - instantly making him the man United turned to. When factoring in the team's overall dip this season, Fernandes has, arguably, continued to perform with 15 goal involvements in the Premier League - only five players in the division have more - and creating a league-high 66 chances from open play. Broken down, only Cristiano Ronaldo has scored more goals and Paul Pogba has carved more assists at United. The 27-year-old has made more touches and passes in the final third than any player at the club and regained possession in the final third a team-topping 23 times. Has the team's dip affected Fernandes, or has his dip affected the team? The question alone underlines his importance and his returns remain impressive during a troubled season - and a new five-year contract suggests the hierarchy agrees.

World Cup Qualifying: State of play World Cup Qualifying tables Four-time World Cup winners Germany were the first team to guarantee a spot through the qualification process in Europe, while Brazil - the most successful national team in World Cup history with five trophies - secured qualification as one of the top four teams in South America's groups. England secured their place in November by topping their qualifying group. Canada qualified for the World Cup finals for just the second time, beating Jamaica 4-0 to book their ticket to Qatar and end 36 years of failure and heartache. Mexico and the United States also qualified for the World Cup in their final qualifier, and Senegal, Ghana, Tunisia, Morocco and Cameroon were among the final countries to book their places at Qatar 2022. In Europe, Portugal and Poland progressed to the finals after winning their play-off finals against North Macedonia and Sweden respectively. The third and final European play-off, which will feature Wales against Scotland or Ukraine, has been delayed until June. Wales, Scotland or Ukraine will be at the World Cup as play-off winners. Meanwhile, the intercontinental play-offs will be contested on 13-14 June in Qatar with Australia or UAE or Peru plus Costa Rica or New Zealand taking the two remaining places. UEFA and Intercontinental play-offs: Because Scotland and Wales have been pitched in the same path, it means Scotland and Wales will play each other for a place at next year's World Cup if Scotland progress past Ukraine in their delayed play-off semi-final. The 2022 World Cup will begin with 32 teams in eight groups of four: Four matches will be played each day during the group stage, which will run over a 12-day period and see winners and runners-up progress to the round of 16.

The reigning European champions must overturn a two-goal deficit in next week's return in the Bernabeu to have any chance of defending their crown after Karim Benzema scored two extraordinary first-half headers and punished Edouard Mendy's error to leave 13-time winners Real in control after his hat-trick in successive Champions League outings. The odds are stacked against Chelsea progressing through to the semi-finals, with just one of the previous 43 sides who trailed by two or more goals in a Champions League knockout tie overturning such a deficit away from home in the competition's history. Asked if he thought the tie was still alive, Chelsea boss Tuchel said: ""Today, is this [tie] alive with this performance? No, not at the moment. ""We have to find ourselves again, I don't know where we have been since the international break. Tonight was a repetition of the second half against Brentford in a quarter-final against Real Madrid. Five days, seven goals conceded. I don't think there is a deeper reason or it. It's alarming. ""With everything the game demands, you cannot expect a result from this kind of performance. We were so far off our level, tactically, individually, in shape, in challenges. We tried to play in a new formation and killed the game off with a big mistake. ""It's never on one player or players, it's on all of us, including myself. Individually we lost shape and sharpness. Since the international break, we have obviously not looked the same and I don't really have an explanation. We came from a long winning streak where we were really competitive, but the first half was by far not good enough."" Chelsea 1-3 Real Madrid - Match report Champions League hits and misses How the teams lined up Match stats If Chelsea are to pull off an unlikely comeback in next week's return leg at the Bernabeu, Tuchel believes the manner of his side's response in Saturday's Premier League trip to Southampton, which now dominates his focus, will be crucial. ""We have to prepare for Saturday against Southampton and not the [return leg at the] Bernabeu,"" Tuchel elaborated. ""If we continue to play like this, we will not get a point [at Southampton]. ""I worry more about Southampton than Real Madrid in the next week, there is my focus. First of all we need to play Southampton. ""If we don't get our heads and legs straight and our mentality right, we will not win in Southampton and then this tie is not alive. ""If things change, maybe, but how many clubs in worldwide football won with what we need, three goals difference? How often did this happen? Maybe it's only realistic to answer like this."" Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti praised Benzema after yet another match-winning display from the striker and said his side are ""lucky to have him"". Benzema became just the fourth player in Champions League history to score back-to-back hat-tricks in the competition on Wednesday night, following on from his treble against Paris Saint-Germain in the previous round. But Ancelotti was keen to point out that it is not just his goalscoring that sets him apart. ""Benzema is a really complete - not striker - player,"" said Ancelotti after the game. ""He gets better every day, like wine. Every day he becomes an even better leader, and feels more how important he is for the team and for the club. I think this is what is making the difference with him, he has a stronger personality now, he knows he is a very important player and that's why he is an example for everybody. ""He scores a lot of goals and this is really important, but he helps the team a lot in possession. He is always in the right position. We are really happy and lucky to have him."" Ancelotti, a former Chelsea manager, is refusing to underestimate the reigning European champions for the second leg. ""I think Chelsea is a fantastic team, with fantastic players,"" he added. ""I still think that the next game will be tough against them. For this we are focused. ""We clearly have the lead, but the outcome is still open. The fact that the away-goal rule is gone is an advantage for Chelsea. We respect them a lot because they are a good team. Tonight Madrid was the better team, but there will be another match and anything can happen."" Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

22,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12587643/klopp-it-was-like-a-boxing-fight-pep-he-likes-these-punching-games,Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp describes thrilling Manchester City draw as 'like a boxing fight',"Jurgen Klopp likened Liverpool's exhilarating 2-2 draw with Manchester City on Super Sunday to a ""boxing fight"" as the Premier League's title protagonists traded blows at the Etihad Stadium. Kevin De Bruyne fired the champions into a fifth-minute lead at the Etihad Stadium but Diogo Jota levelled eight minutes later for the second-placed Reds. Gabriel Jesus restored City's advantage before the break but Sadio Mane marked his 30th birthday with a second equaliser for Jurgen Klopp's men. Raheem Sterling thought he had put City ahead for a third time against his former club but VAR ruled against him in a tight offside decision and substitute Riyad Mahrez hit the post late on. The result ended Liverpool's 10-match winning league run and left City a point clear with just seven games of the season remaining. City retain their one-point lead at the summit, and Klopp told Sky Sports: ""It was like a boxing fight. You have your arms down for a second and get a massive knock and you shake a little. ""I liked a lot of things. I thought we were closer than ever. The second half start was much better. City really tried obviously things like balls in behind. It makes sense when you have these smart runs. In moments when we tried to breathe a little bit another one comes. It was a great game and the result, we have to live with and can live with. Man City-Liverpool ratings: KDB shines Man City 2-2 Liverpool - Match report and highlights Premier League table Get Sky Sports ""We could do better but in a lot of moments, we did really well. The intensity of the game is crazy. It was good fun, I liked it."" On what he said to his players at half-time, Klopp added: ""We showed [our] goal because it was a really good football situation which if we did more we would have chances. I was convinced we could win this game. They were much more direct than us today. They had a more direct idea than us and we wanted to let them run when in possession. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""Defensively we were sometimes in a rush, they put us under pressure and we can defend these situations better. The second half was really intense, they needed breaks as well, but their counter-attacks are not bad. Their decision making is really good and they always pick the right player. ""I think it is a completely fine and deserved draw. We wanted to make sure they see my boys are exceptional as well. ""Seven games to go for both teams and we will not stop chasing now that's for sure. Let's make sure we are ready for Benfica, for this team at Wembley [in the FA Cup semi-final] and then we will see who will have the better finish."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Manchester boss Pep Guardiola: ""He [Klopp] likes these punching games. It was a fantastic advert for the Premier League. Both teams wanted to win. I had the feeling we left them alive but Liverpool are a joy to watch, I know how good and difficult they are. ""We performed really, really well. I'm so proud of the team. Now we have seven games left and we have to win all of them or it will be over. ""I said before the game it doesn't matter if we win or lose. Of course, it was a massive game but we know what we have to do. Seven games is a lot of games, tough games away - so do they. ""I don't know what is going to happen if we win the Premier League but to be there for the fifth season - and I want to win the Premier League - is so good that is doesn't matter [if we lose the title]."" On Klopp, Guardiola added: ""He makes me a better manager. His teams are positive and aggressive in attack. I try to imitate him in that sense. We aren't friends, we don't have dinner together, I have his telephone number but I don't call him but I have a lot of respect for him and he knows. And next Saturday I will try to beat him."" The much-hyped contest lived up to expectations with the game starting at a ferocious pace and hardly relenting. City were the first to hit their stride with Jesus teeing up Sterling for a glorious chance inside the opening minutes - and after Jesus had re-established City's lead, there was a period when - to use boxing parlance - Liverpool were on the ropes. But just 47 seconds of the second half had elapsed when Salah played in his fellow forward and Mane made no mistake. Jamie Carragher told Sky Sports: ""It took more courage from Liverpool because Manchester City are such a special team technically. We've not seen anyone like them in our league. Every other team in the Premier League when they play Man City, they drop off and they hope for a goal on the counter-attack. ""Liverpool are the only team who try to take them on at their own game - and they're good enough to do that."" ""The performance from Liverpool not so much in terms of quality but their mentality to come out in the second half. They'd been given the run around in the first half. ""I don't think they did anything completely different. They didn't change. These teams believe in what they do and rightly so. To come out in the second half and match City, maybe do better, I was so impressed with both sides today."" Gary Neville added: ""Liverpool showed guts to come back into the game as City in the first half could've been out of sight. They keep coming back and the best teams have that ability, character and personality trait. ""Well done to Liverpool as City were exceptional in the first half. There was quality but it was frantic at times. You could see at the end when they were bringing each other down, they were panicking a little bit thinking about the counter-attack. ""But they are exceptional teams. What I admire most about them is from a defensive point of view. I don't know how they do it. They push high up the pitch with 10 minutes to go. ""The nerve to do that against the best in the world with the best passers and best runners is unbelievable. We've seen the best teams push up in the past but never like these two teams do in the game today."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports Jamie Carragher: ""I think Jurgen Klopp will be satisfied. Before the game, obviously he'd have wanted three points but the second half showed how they got back into the game having been 2-1 down. They'll be delighted with a point as Liverpool weren't at the races in the first half. ""They deserve credit for how they responded."" Sky Sports' Micah Richards: ""City are still ahead and they can take confidence from that. If Liverpool would've won today it would've been a rough road to the end of the season but it was a great game of football between two of the best teams I've ever seen. ""This and the reverse fixture in November, I don't think I've seen two matches with such a high quality of football. The players are breath-taking and the managers are on top of their game. Great spectacles. ""Looking at the fixtures, Liverpool have the harder run-in but Jurgen Klopp will be approaching every game one at a time. It is going to be tough no matter what. I thought City were outstanding today The levels of fitness, quality, decision making. I thought City had the better chances. In that first half, I thought City had more than Liverpool."" Sky Sports' Roy Keane: ""We're in the same place as we were before! We just saw great desire and fighting spirit from both teams. All the talk before the game from the managers was that this wouldn't be a decisive game but they both played like it was. ""It was like a final. City had the chance to win it at the end but I think a draw is a fair result. ""What impressed me about these quality players was the desire was still there to go and win the game right until the end. No team was ever going to dominate for long spells because there's so much quality on both sides. ""Liverpool struggled to get going but in the second half, they showed their character. Klopp had a go at them at half-time and they were early out onto the pitch for the start of the season period. ""He wanted them to show their true colours and we saw that before City again some great chances. It was a great reminder of what the game is all about and why we love it.

Was left exposed for Liverpool's second. Brought back into the side but showed the best and worst of his game. In the first half, his electric recovery pace was put to good use to stop Salah and he was sharp to shut down a Robertson pass in the box. But at the start of the second half he got caught out of position for Mane's goal when there was no way back and another piece of poor positioning almost allowed Salah to find Jota for a third. Out of the team in the first half of the season, Stones is back now and, with Ruben Dias missing, provided a solid performance in City's backline on this big stage. Dealt well with the Liverpool threat in the first half and used his passing quality to instigate several City attacks in the second. Laporte is having an impressive season for City and a crucial sliding tackle on Jota just before half-time was another highlight. It would have been a certain penalty and perhaps a red if he'd got it wrong. Hit the post seconds later when he was rightly flagged offside from a free-kick but some top defending against Alexander-Arnold in the box and a block on a Salah shot after the break were reminders of where his strengths lie. An attacking force down the left for Man City and it was another example of his wonderful passing range for the hosts' second, bending the ball to the back post for Jesus. Before then he could have had an assist when De Bruyne shot into the side-netting and a goal of his own when his deflected effort hit a post. Made a sleepy start to the second half and was fortunate not to be punished, but overall another impressive display. Another classy performance from City's orchestrator. His quick free-kick got them moving for the first goal after his early pass led to a good chance for Sterling. He had the most touches for City in the first half, none more stylish than the couple he used for kick-ups in his own half to spin away from Henderson. Get NOW to stream big moments Get Sky Sports Premier League table Watch Premier League highlights Covered a lot of ground in the centre of the park against an energetic Liverpool midfield but a moment when precise control was required let him down, with his header from a set-piece across goal to Stones miscued and a simple tap-in opportunity missed. But did his main tasks with distinction, as usual. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A performance which reminded everyone - if they needed - why he is so highly rated. City's star man stepped up and delivered inside five minutes when his deflected strike flew in off a post to get the defending champions going. He had his head in his hands on the half-hour when he hit the side netting, but repeatedly passed through the Liverpool lines and a tight offside call on Sterling and a Mahrez miss denied him an assist. Foden gave James Milner nightmares down the left flank at Anfield but he struggled to have the same kind of impact on Sunday up against Alexander-Arnold. As stylish on the ball as ever but when he did come inside the Liverpool right-back, Matip was there to shepherd him away from the danger zone. Was unable to create a clear chance. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A nearly-match for Sterling against his former club. He's been coming back into form and it felt like he'd have a say today but he squandered a one-on-one in the opening minutes and when he did convert from a similar chance in the second half he was flagged marginally offside. Subbed off for Mahrez with 15 to play and a feeling it wasn't quite his day. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Overthinking it? Pep Guardiola's surprise selection paid off in this one. Jesus, making his first Premier League start since New Year's Day, hit the net from Cancelo's excellent cross after a brilliantly-timed run got him in behind Alexander-Arnold. Before then he'd put a chance on a plate for Sterling and seen a penalty shout turned away after being upended by Alisson. Saw a goal-bound shot blocked by Van Dijk in the second half and got carried away shooting into the side-netting when better options were available, but an impressive return. What a chance to win it! What a miss! Released by De Bruyne in the final seconds, he got his shot/lob all wrong. And that came after his free-kick clipped a post. Almost the hero... Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Had one moment, twisting and turning in the box, but will be frustrated not to have got on earlier. The frustrating life of a goalkeeper: Alisson pulled off a brilliant save from Sterling inside five minutes from a one-on-one chance but 39 seconds later a wicked deflection gave him no hope with De Bruyne's opener. Could do little about Jesus' close-range finish for City's second, either. A touch of real quality teed up Jota for Liverpool's equaliser - another fine assist to add to his collection. And he thought he might score a goal to go down in history when he spotted Ederson off his line but his effort from halfway was miscued. Questions were asked about his defending when he was caught out by Jesus' run in behind for City's second, with Sky Sports' Roy Keane pointing at his body position, but was generally solid on the back foot. A reassuring presence in the Liverpool defence alongside Alexander-Arnold to help close down any threat from Foden or, late on, Grealish. His deflection gave Alisson no chance for the opener - could he have got out quicker to the City man? - but gave Liverpool a good base against this talented attacking team of Guardiola's. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A late booking for a cynical foul on De Bruyne blotted his copybook after what was an otherwise typically stylish centre-back display. Whether he was sweeping up a Walker cross aimed for Foden early on, blocking a Jesus goal-bound shot or snuffing out Sterling's run through on goal with pace, positioning and timing in the tackle, Van Dijk did it all with an air of calm which belied the occasion. Combined with Alexander-Arnold in the build-up to Jota's equaliser and booked for taking out De Bruyne on the touchline to sum up the blend of quality and bite he brings to this team. Another reliable display on the big stage from the Scotsman. Not at his best and at times off the pace. Made it too easy for De Bruyne to break into space and unleash his shot for City's opener, gave the ball away to Rodri whose own ricocheted effort went over, and beaten by Jesus in the box when his compatriot's shot was blocked by Van Dijk. Had to take out Silva when the City man got away from him and was perhaps fortunate not to see red. Lots of energy but finesse missing from Liverpool's captain. He played couple of balls over top in the first half as Liverpool struggled to grab control but eventually got it right just before the break, although Jota failed to make the most of it. Subbed in the second half. Had to wait 10 minutes for his first touch after City's dominant start but an outrageous switch of play to Alexander-Arnold in build-up to Liverpool's first goal got him going. Never one to back away from a fight, he was booked for chopping down De Bruyne in midfield was perhaps fortunate not to get another yellow when he caught the City man again after being tugged back by Rodri. Helped the Reds gain some control in that area of the pitch at points during the game. Came into the game with questions over his form and was hardly in the game in the first half but for one darting run past Laporte which was covered by Walker. But he showed his game is about more than just goals seconds into the second period, rolling a perfectly-weighted pass into Mane's path to make it 2-2. ""What a pass,"" said Gary Neville on co-commentary. A trademark left-foot curler was blocked by Laporte to extend his wait for an open-play goal but made his impact with that assist.

On in the final stages for Henderson but wasn't able to give Liverpool's midfield the added thrust to come up with a dramatic winner. Sent on for the last six minutes but didn't get his big chance.

24,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/15115/12584332/the-making-of-erik-ten-hag,Erik ten Hag to Manchester United: His coaching journey from Twente to Ajax via Go Ahead Eagles explained in detail,"Erik ten Hag will go to Manchester United as an outsider tasked with implementing cultural change at one of the world’s most famous clubs. But that is a job that he has done before. At Ajax, they mocked his accent. He was a Tukker - a man from the east of the country, a region known for a down-to-earth approach. There were those in sophisticated Amsterdam who did not believe the great Ajax had anything to learn from him. They were wrong. Two domestic doubles and one kick away from a Champions League final later and there is an acceptance Ten Hag has brought some of the best football that Ajax has seen in years. His methods have delivered success, his manner has won over the doubters. The ascent to perhaps the biggest job in football might feel swift but his progress has been steady, methodically planned to maximise his skill-set. At 52, he has been a youth coach and a head of education, an assistant at home and abroad, and a manager at various levels. In a series of interviews with former team-mates, those who played with him as a teenager and were later captained by him, with players who he led to promotion in his first head coaching role, a picture emerges of an original thinker, a motivator and a disciplinarian. This is the making of Erik ten Hag. Raised in north Haaksbergen, a small town not far from the city of Enschede, life was idyllic in those early years. Jumpers for goalposts, football until dark. Ten Hag was good enough at it to shine when playing for Bon Boys, the local club where he is still a member. Get Sky Sports Transfer Centre LIVE! Premier League table Man Utd fixtures Leon ten Voorde, a childhood friend turned journalist remembers a cheerful boy and a rebellious teenager, not the strict disciplinarian obsessed with detail. But Ten Hag was captain of Bon Boys, nevertheless. Leadership was in his genes, according to Ten Voorde. Boudewijn Pahlplatz recalls it the same way. When Ten Hag was picked up by FC Twente, the biggest club in the region, Pahlplatz played alongside him for the youth team, the reserves and eventually the first team, across two different spells at Twente. ""After that, we even worked together when he was the head of education and I was a coach,"" Pahlplatz tells Sky Sports. They last spoke in the summer at a reunion to mark 20 years since Twente won the KNVB Cup for only the second time in their history. ""When I came back to Twente, I was not really fit any more because I had some problems with my muscles and Erik was the captain. He was an average player, but he was a good team player. Even when he was playing, he was already a coach, always knowing better."" In a team that included Netherlands international Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and those such as Pahlplatz who had enjoyed greater success at PSV Eindhoven, not everyone appreciated this central defender who was barking orders at them from the back. ""That was not always popular with the players because he was not the best player. When you are not the best player, it is hard for the better players to accept it. But he was thinking like a coach and the truth is that he always had the best tactical thoughts. ""Twenty years on, you can see that he was right all along."" 'He has built his career very carefully' The playing journey with Twente that had begun when they were teenagers ended for Pahlplatz and Ten Hag in 2002, but the latter moved seamlessly into a coaching role with the U17 side. He did that for a season before assuming control of the U19 group. There were early signs of his dedication. Wout Brama, now back at Twente but then an academy player, recalls wondering what they were up against when Ten Hag's first decision was to cut their holiday short by two weeks. Impact was quick. Progress was steady. ""He built his career very carefully,"" says Pahlplatz. 2002-2003: Twente U17 coach  2003-2006: Twente U19 coach  2006-2009: Twente assistant manager  2009-2012: PSV Eindhoven assistant manager  2012-2013: Go Ahead Eagles manager  2013-2015: Bayern Munich II manager  2015-2017: Utrecht manager  2017-2022: Ajax manager Ten Hag was later an assistant under Fred Rutten, then Steve McClaren, before following Rutten to PSV for three seasons. It was in the summer of 2012, aged 42 and after a decade of coaching, that he took his first head coaching job with Go Ahead Eagles. ""It has been step by step, developing his own philosophy and his own way of playing. That is very good. These days you see too many old players who immediately want to run a first team. That is very hard. You have to be so good that it is only for some players."" The opportunity at Eagles was not an obvious one. This was a club that had been relegated from the Eredivisie in 1996 and stayed in the second tier for the subsequent 16 seasons. Standards had slipped, expectations had dipped. Ten Hag soon changed that. Sjoerd Overgoor was not optimistic when he found out Ten Hag would be his new head coach. The young midfielder was trying to make his way in the game after being released by Twente as a teenager. One of the men responsible for that decision? Ten Hag. ""He had been the head of the youth academy at Twente when I was sent away and told that I was not good enough,"" Overgoor tells Sky Sports. ""I had a contract at Go Ahead Eagles so you can imagine how I felt when it was announced. But it went completely differently."" At the end of that season, there were celebrations on the pitch and in the stands as the club's 17-year wait to play in the Eredivisie would soon be at an end. Nobody there was in any doubt about the identity of the man who had been the main factor in that success. ""It was the most special day of my career,"" says Overgoor. ""I am not a great player, but because of Erik ten Hag I played in the highest division. He is the best coach that I have ever had. He was the reason. You don't see coaches that good in the second division."" Bart Vriends was part of the Eagles team, arriving on loan from Utrecht that winter to strengthen the defence. That season is fresh in his mind because he has been working on a documentary about it, the central figure interviewing team-mates - and Ten Hag. Every player tells him the same thing. ""What really came out from those conversations with everyone involved was that Erik ten Hag changed the professionalism at the club in just a couple of weeks at the start of pre-season,"" Vriends tells Sky Sports. ""This was a small mid-table second division club in a small city in the east. It grew into something else when he was in charge. He changed the mentality in the club. He changed the mentality of the players and the people who worked there. From day one, actually."" Ten Hag is fastidious. One of the first things he noticed was that the woman in charge of the kits at the club would bring out drinks and set them out on the table inside the dressing room. ""She would put the drinks there just randomly,"" says Vriends. This was a problem for Ten Hag. ""He wanted the drinks put out in straight lines. Everything had to be perfect in his eyes. People needed time to get used to that."" There are so many stories like this. ""We had one man whose job it was to look after the pitch,"" says Overgoor. ""Every day Erik would be coming to him and saying that the grass had to be two millimetres or something like that. That was a big difference for everyone at the club. He changed everything. ""Remember, this is not a big club in Holland. We did not have the best facilities but he made them the best. A lot of coaches come to clubs like Eagles and have the attitude that they have to deal with it. He did not deal with it. Instead, he made it better and better."" Detail was everything, as Overgoor found out in pre-season. ""We did a lot of ball work, but a few times in the afternoon we would have to run in the woods in groups. He would say that we had to run a certain distance in two minutes. We wanted to prove ourselves to him so our group did it in one minute and 50 seconds. ""He said, 'No. If I tell you to run for two minutes I don't want you to take two minutes and 10 seconds but I also don't want you to run for one minute and 50 seconds. Two minutes is two minutes. He was like that. If you did not stick to the plan you had a problem."" Some of the stories about Ten Hag make him sound like a tough taskmaster, but there was another side to his coaching. He was an innovator intent on raising standards. That meant placing demands on players, but also providing them with a better environment. Vriends had arrived from Utrecht. ""A bigger and more fashionable club back then."" But the attention to detail was still a surprise to him. ""He put beds in the dressing room so we could rest and sleep in between the two training sessions. That was really new at that time."" Video analysis helped take things to another level. ""It was the first time that I had experienced that. Remember, this was 10 years ago at Go Ahead Eagles. After matches, we would go to his room individually and be shown our clips. He was never satisfied."" One seemingly trivial example is cited by both of his former players, clearly leaving an impression. ""He put a window in his office door,"" remembers Overgoor. ""We were all saying to each other that he was doing that so he could see what we were doing."" Ten Hag later revealed the real reason. ""He said, 'No, if the door is closed and there is no window it is difficult to come in because maybe I am busy and people will not want to knock. Now people will see if I am free and that makes it easier to come in.' These were the details that he thought about. ""That was really impressive to me. It was something I had not seen before."" Vriends agrees. ""He had put this big glass window in just so that it made things more transparent, helping with communication. It is a little example of how he changed the thinking."" Ten Hag had to do more than change the thinking, he had to change the results. That process also began in pre-season but took rather longer to perfect. Before the wins started to come, there were hours and hours of work put in on the training ground. ""We played a lot of 11 against zero,"" recalls Overgoor. The team would line up as they would for a game but with no opposition in place, practising how they intended to move the ball around the pitch. It is a favourite of coaches but not too much fun for the players. ""Every time we would start with the goalkeeper and he would talk us through the patterns of how we could attack. He wanted diagonal balls. Every time that we played a straight ball he would stop us and make us do it again. He was very strict in terms of what he wanted. ""After four weeks of 11 against zero we were thinking, 'What is this? It is so boring.' But after a couple of months of the season, there were matches where we knew what we had to do and everyone was seeing it the same way. It was really clear and it was working."" By the time that Vriends arrived in January, Ten Hag had established his idea and the mood had changed. ""There were really interesting coaching sessions,"" he says. Overgoor agrees. ""We became confident in our style of play and it became better and better."" That style was 4-3-3. ""Like at Ajax,"" adds Overgoor. ""Sometimes he made changes at half-time but nothing weird. Maybe one midfielder had to come 10 metres deeper to gain more ball possession. That is his big quality. He knows how to change it to become better."" Perhaps influenced by having been released at Twente, Overgoor thought Ten Hag had a problem with him at first. ""He would shout at me,"" he recalls. ""I thought that he did not like me. Other players recognise it too and they said the same thing to me."" It took a conversation to clear the air. ""I asked him what I was doing wrong because he was always shouting at me. He told me that I was the sort of guy who was happy with 90 per cent but if I was angry I could give even more and would improve. ""Once he told me that, I knew that when he shouted he just wanted more. I had been negative but it turned into a positive. He believed in me but felt I had more to give."" Man-management was usually reserved for football matters. ""A lot of the time it is only about football, not about family or something else. Every day he wanted to talk about football and improve, improve, improve. But he knew what every player needed and that is a good thing to have as a coach."" Vriends remembers it the same way. ""I have not seen him a lot with a relaxed kind of vibe, up for a laugh or a chilled training session. He is always really serious. But I guess that is just the standard of top-level football. It took us a while to get into that. But it worked."" Harsh but fair is a mantra that wins respect in the dressing room. ""Every single player in that squad, even the ones on the bench, were really happy with him actually,"" adds Vriends. Pahlplatz also notes that ability to unite a squad. At Ajax, a club that has had its divisions in the past, the atmosphere among the group has rarely been a problem. ""He was always good with players. He always protects them. He can be hard with players but players are always very positive about him - even players who don't play or players who leave to go to another club. They all say he is a good coach and a good person."" Following promotion with Go Ahead Eagles, there was some frustration Ten Hag decided not to continue the journey with them in the Eredivisie and instead moved to Bayern Munich, taking their reserve team while Pep Guardiola coached the seniors. ""I was surprised and a little bit disappointed because I knew he would make me a better player,"" says Overgoor. ""But he was too good for us so it was normal that he would leave. It is the same with players. If they are too good, they leave. He was too good to stay. ""We were lucky because in the first year of the Eredivisie we had nine of the same 11 players, so in that first year without him we played exactly how Erik wanted us to play. That is why we stayed in the highest division that year, I think."" There is less surprise at the success that Ten Hag has enjoyed since. ""I knew he had it in him. We knew he was special. He went to Bayern Munich and then to Utrecht."" Vriends even played a part in him moving there. ""I remember the board at Utrecht contacted me because they wanted some information about this guy who they wanted as their new head coach. I was only positive about it. They took him and it was a massive success. It did not surprise me at all. ""I guess I should have been paid for that. I would be rich."" Ten Hag has had to evolve since those Go Ahead Eagles days. At Utrecht, he moved away from his 4-3-3 formation to utilise two strikers instead. It worked again. They finished fifth in his first season and fourth in his second - taking the club into Europe. ""I think he just adapts to the players that he has,"" says Vriends. ""We had wingers on the sides and played an attacking, dominant, passing game. At Utrecht, he changed formation to suit the players that he had. He did not really stick to this Dutch style of football."" At Ajax, he did return to that 4-3-3 formation but put his own twist on things - on and off the pitch. He had to convince a club, one with a very clear philosophy about how things should be done, that he had ideas of his own. It took time but that is what he did. ""At the beginning there too, people needed to get used to him,"" says Vriends. ""He was this serious man from the east of the country with this funny accent. It did not really seem to fit with Ajax at first. But within weeks it was all good. He changed the mentality. ""I think he actually changed the standards at the club."" A recurring theme of Ten Hag's career has been proving people wrong. That will be a challenge at Manchester United for various reasons. Patience is a virtue but the Premier League is full of sinners. Will he be given the time? Even his admirers doubt that. ""If you have a board who do not have patience it could be done after a few months,"" says Overgoor. ""But the board trusted him at Utrecht and at Ajax and you see what happens next. It was the same at Eagles. It was up and down. After that, it was up, up and up. ""At Ajax, they had the patience. I don't know if Manchester United has that patience if the results do not come in the first few months because there is so much more going on. If he is given the time he will do the job. He has shown everywhere that he is good enough."" Those training-ground methods might be an issue, says Pahlplatz. ""He does a lot of repetition. That was almost a problem for him in the beginning at Utrecht and Ajax. He trained them very hard and very long to get his philosophy into the players. That takes hours. The Utrecht and Ajax players were not used to that. ""He brought a new philosophy and that was a struggle for him at first. He demands so much of the players. Afterwards, you can see that it pays off. At the beginning, to convince players of his ideas is difficult. But you see how he has Ajax playing now, it is unbelievable."" Overgoor does not expect those 11 versus zero sessions to be repeated. ""He had to do it with us because we were not as good and needed some patterns to build on. He does not make Dusan Tadic and Daley Blind do 11 versus zero, they have more freedom. ""I don't think he will be telling Cristiano Ronaldo what to do."" That thought is a reminder that Manchester United is different. Pahlplatz remembers his conversations with McClaren at Twente. ""He used to tell us how it was with the media there. It is 24 hours a day at Manchester United. It is something you have to get used to. ""There are only a few Dutch coaches who have been at the biggest clubs in the world like Manchester United. Louis van Gaal was there, Leo Beenhakker and Guus Hiddink at Real Madrid, Johan Cruyff and Ronald Koeman at Barcelona. This is the level we are talking. ""He knows German football. He knows Dutch football. How will he cope with English football and all that comes with it? ""That is the interesting question. Will he deal with it?"" Pros:  Attractive football that players understand  Tactically smart  Not afraid to push young talent  Good relationship with players   Cons:  Does not love the limelight  Man Utd is a commercially huge club  Will he stick to 4-3-3? Premier League demands flexibility Fresh from spending an hour with Ten Hag reminiscing about their time together at Go Ahead Eagles, Vriends is convinced his old boss will adapt, just as he has to every previous challenge. ""I sound like his agent but I think this is a really wise choice by Manchester United to go for him. It seems like a tough club to manage but I do think it is a wise decision. ""His success has not surprised me at all. He is still the best manager that I have seen in my career and he has taken every step since then. For me, that season together was huge. One to remember. For him, it was just the beginning of his coaching career."" It was the making of Erik ten Hag. Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

Footage, taken by @EvertonHub, shows Ronaldo lowering his right hand towards the ground before what appears to be a phone colliding with and bouncing up off the surface, as he exited the pitch following the 1-0 defeat at Goodison Park. Ronaldo has since apologised for the ""outburst"". The fan's mother has claimed he was left ""bruised"" by the incident, which left the youngster ""in complete shock"". Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Sarah Kelly said her 14-year-old son Jake Harding is autistic and ""didn't really digest what was happening"" until he got home. ""He's really upset about it, and it's completely put him off going to the game again,"" she told the paper. ""This is the first football game he's been to and this has happened."" Jake, she said, wasn't waving his phone in Ronaldo's face - and it was down by the floor when the Portuguese striker moved towards it. She also shared an image of her son's hand with the newspaper, in which it appeared red and bruised.

""We can confirm that we are liaising with Manchester United Football Club and Everton FC following reports of an alleged assault at the Everton v Manchester United football match at Goodison,"" a statement read. ""As players were leaving the pitch at 2.30pm, it was reported that a boy was assaulted by one of the away team as they left the pitch. ""Inquiries are under way and officers are currently working with Everton Football Club to review CCTV footage and are carrying out extensive witness enquiries to establish if an offence has taken place. ""Anyone with information on this incident is asked to contact Merseyside Police social media desk via Twitter @MerPolCC or Facebook Merseyside Police Contact centre quoting reference number 228 of 9 April 2022."" Manchester United have confirmed they are aware of the matter. A club spokesperson said in a statement: ""We are aware of an alleged incident after today's game at Everton and the club will co-operate with any police inquiries."" The Football Association will also speak to Ronaldo, Manchester United and Everton to seek their observations over the incident. An FA spokesperson added: ""We are aware of the incident and will be seeking observations on the matter from both clubs and the player involved."" Ronaldo had earlier apologised for the incident on Instagram and invited the fan to a match at Old Trafford. He said on Instagram: ""It's never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing. Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game. ""I would like to apologise for my outburst and, if possible, I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship"" United are aware of the footage, which was widely shared and discussed on social media following the game. It was a bad day on the pitch for Ronaldo and Manchester United as Anthony Gordon's first-half goal gave the hosts three points. United, who have won just once in five Premier League games, now look unlikely to qualify for the Champions League next season. David de Gea described Manchester United's defeat to relegation-threatened Everton as ""a disgrace"" after their season reached a new low at Goodison Park. ""It's a disgrace from us, to be honest, we should win the game,"" De Gea told BT Sport. ""We don't create, that's the problem. We don't even create proper chances to score.

Anthony Gordon boosted Everton's chances of Premier League survival as his first-half strike proved the difference in a scrappy affair against United. Gordon's deflected effort before the half-hour alleviated the pressure on Frank Lampard after a 3-2 midweek defeat at relegation rivals Burnley had left Everton just a solitary point above the drop zone. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player This was far from a vintage display from either side but a 1-0 win for the Toffees puts daylight between themselves and the bottom three as United's top-four ambitions suffered another untimely dent. Rangnick's men sit seventh in the table, three points off fourth-placed Tottenham having played one game more, while Arsenal are in fifth placed with two games in hand over United. ""If you don't score a single goal in 95 minutes we have to be disappointed. We had a good start and should have created more chances out of that domination. Then we concede a deflected shot and lost a bit of our composure. ""The second half we were trying to add creativity with substitutions but we didn't always take the right decision. Get Sky Sports Premier League table Premier League results Watch Premier League highlights Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""We had to do something. We needed a goal and we decided to bring Mata and more verticality with Elanga. They were defending with their players in the last 35 minutes. We didn't find the right player at the right moment. We didn't have enough players in the box when we played crosses."" ""It's not only creativity. I think we had enough creative players on the pitch. It's also about being physical enough in the final third, being physical and trying to score a goal. We didn't have enough players in the box."" On United's top-four hopes, he added: ""It's difficult. As long as we don't win our own games it doesn't make sense to hope for good results from the other teams. ""Fred had some muscular problems on his hip flexor. We already are without McTominay. Without both defensive midfielders it isn't good for us."" Rangnick made half a dozen changes from the side that drew 1-1 against Leicester last week - Lampard himself made four - as Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcus Rashford were restored to the starting XI. The bustling Rashford was thwarted twice early on by Jordan Pickford but Ronaldo was largely subdued as United remain cut adrift from the Champions League places after being downed by Gordon's shot, which thudded into visiting captain Harry Maguire and left goalkeeper David De Gea stranded. Everton, up until that point, were lacking in inspiration but they noticeably grew in stature after going ahead, when the mood around Goodison Park dramatically changed, although they were given relatively few scares by a United side that have won just one of their last five top-flight fixtures. Despite coming off in the 64th minute, Marcus Rashford attempted more shots at goal (3) and had more touches in the opposition's box (6) than any other player in the match. It is scant consolation for the disgruntled travelling fans but it is something that Rangnick can take with him back to Manchester. The United interim boss continued: ""We had a good start to the game in the first 25 minutes, we were in full control. Saying that, we didn't create enough advantage from this period, especially on the left side. We had our moments and could've scored despite me wishing for us to be more penetrating. ""You could literally feel they were crumbling after the defeat against Burnley but we couldn't take advantage. In the second half, they defended with all their players on the pitch and weren't able to break that wall down."" ""There's no point looking at the table when you perform like that. It's difficult to say why as our training sessions were aggressive and the signs were there. We didn't pin them back and this is also one of our problems right now as we don't win the balls to then create the chances. ""I don't see any connection [when asked if Erik ten Hag talk is a distraction]. I don't see any connection between this issue or this excuse. A new manager is coming soon. It doesn't matter if it is announced in five days, 15 days or 20 days. All the players want to play at the highest level, in the Champions League, but if we play as we did today then we don't deserve it. ""The players shouldn't struggle with the expectation at this club. You have to score the first goal in a game like this. We have to help the team to find better solutions. We had four strikers on the pitch for the first 60 minutes and played like we did. We need to be more penetrative but in total we just didn't have enough players in the box."" Given both teams are low on confidence, it was perhaps little surprise that it was a cagey opening few minutes, complete with stray passes and the sides loose in possession, although Everton were particularly hesitant, with United getting on top and having two early sights at goal through Rashford. The hitherto out-of-form forward was lively on the left and had a snap shot parried away by the outstretched Pickford, who moments later excellently got down low to deny a header from the England forward as Gordon snuffed out any danger on the rebound. Everton appeared listless and lethargic, with their fans growing restless, but the atmosphere and momentum changed as they took a 27th-minute lead following some sluggishness at the back from United. ""I've got to give the lads a lot of credit here having lost twice in a week,"" Lampard said. ""To go again Saturday morning against a team that's fresh and full of quality was excellent. It was joined-up with the fans, it's been good here since I've arrived by that's not a given. The players put the effort in. We've been due one of those, a deflection, something to hang onto. ""I'm pleased for Anthony. He feels it, he's grown up here and he's mature beyond his age. No wonder the fans love him. It's always a team effort and Jordan made two big saves in the first half and an outstanding one at the end. It felt outstanding. His quality makes the save. Jordan is England's No 1 for a reason and he absolutely showed it today."" Lampard pumped his fist on the touchline, and no doubt breathed a sigh of relief, following a momentous win - just the third in his tenure in the league in 10 attempts. ""We know it's in our hands, regardless of the others, to stay in the league. Some people around me have been calculating how many more points or wins we need but I'm not focused on that. We just need to keep performing like this.""

Speaking to Sky Sports at United's Carrington base straight after a press conference where the thorny topics of Louis van Gaal's apparent vendetta against United and Nemanja Matic's comments about camp morale were on the agenda, the 63-year-old seems far more at ease discussing how best to elevate his adopted club back into contention for silverware. It is less than five months since he took the top job at Old Trafford, and had the league started that day United would be fourth. It will be seen as a relative success should they occupy that position come the final day of the season, a truth which lays bare the scale of the task the next manager - and Rangnick in his next role - will have in bridging the gap to the Premier League summit. ""It's obvious that something needs to be changed, something needs to be rebuilt in the summer,"" he tells Sky Sports. ""The team could do with some more highly-talented, hungry players who really want to develop their own careers. ""I don't think it should be that much about signing big names. I wouldn't mind big names! But for me it's important about being competitive, hungry, seeing a move to a club - and I have always believed this - not only as a big contract, a big-name club, but the next logical step in his career. ""If this happens, then you have a completely different level of motivation, aspiration, inspiration to play for whatever club that is. That should be the major target for the summer transfer window."" Of course, if it were as simple as that, why wouldn't every club do it? Rangnick's answer involves patience and time, two commodities which football needs desperately but is often loath to grant. A good manager helps, too. And one of the German's oldest friends in the game is a shining example. Get Sky Sports Watch with a Sports Membership on NOW Rangnick backs Maguire: Boos 'difficult to understand' Live football on Sky Sports this week ""Look at Liverpool,"" he says. ""When Jurgen Klopp came there five-and-a-half years ago it was early in the season, but they still finished eighth in the Premier League with a point average of about 1.6. ""They played in a European final but lost it, and from that summer transfer window onwards, if you compare the line-up from that final to now, there are a couple of players still there, Henderson and Firmino for example, but they added top signings in almost every transfer window. Players for whom that move would've been the next step - Virgil van Dijk, Sadio Mane, Mo Salah. ""It shows it's possible, but you need to have both the quality and process of recruitment and players plus the best possible manager."" The identity of that next manager has been - as everything is around United - a matter of fervent and protracted debate outside the club. Inside it, Erik ten Hag has been spoken to this week, although Rangnick has been separate from internal discussions over his successor. ""We haven't had the time to speak about what will happen with regards to new players or a new manager,"" he says when asked if his advisory role is any closer to being defined. United will hope that managerial appointment will be the one to take them back to the Premier League title, but in the meantime Rangnick has been laying the groundwork ahead of his move upstairs at the end of the season. Within days of his appointment in December he identified a leaky defence as his first hole to fill, and has since set about honing the balance so United retain sufficient firepower to reach the Champions League next season. That presents a challenge which is still very much a work in progress - and will be tested again when his side look to cut the gap to fourth against Leicester, live on Sky Sports Premier League on Saturday evening from 5pm. He says: ""After Christmas we focused to make sure the team was creating enough chances but since then we have had games like the FA Cup game against Middlesbrough, the home game with Watford and a few other games where we didn't score enough goals from the opportunities we created. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""That's why we have dropped too many points, eight draws in total in the league, and too many moments where we were 1-0 or even 2-0 up - at Aston Villa - and then ended up drawing."" Fred may have a surprise role to play in improving United's attacking output thanks to the new role given to him by Rangnick, who has tasked him with becoming a more creative figure in United's midfield. The manager considers him one of the most underrated players at Old Trafford, and seems puzzled why the forward-thinking aspects of his game have often been shackled since his move to Manchester. ""For me, he is an extremely valuable player, a team player in the true sense, a player who puts in every effort that he has and would give his last drop of blood for the team. ""He's also a player who can score goals and has those surprising elements in his game, little flick-ons, and he can be a technical player too. ""That combination makes him extremely valuable, and to reduce him to only a number six, a defensive midfield player, does not rate him highly enough. He can do a lot more than just defend."" One thing Rangnick will not be able to fix before the summer is the spotlight which surrounds himself, his players and the club. United are steeped in history and known the world over, and that will not change - and neither would he want it to. But it does come with its own difficulties, with Matic's admission that the dressing-room atmosphere is ""not fantastic"" the latest in a long line of murmurings. Those 'leaks', if they are indeed genuine, are certainly a frustration for Rangnick who has never had to deal with a media storm on quite this level before. But four months in, it is something he feels he has a hold on, and lays the blame in part on the bloated squad he inherited when he first arrived at Old Trafford. ""I think any manager would wish these things didn't exist, but you have to be aware what information is true and what isn't,"" he says. ""I know the atmosphere in the dressing room between the players is good. ""Obviously, when you lose a game like the one against Atletico, it's not good. But the same will be true of (Sweden's) Anthony Elanga and Victor Lindelof after they lost against Poland - that's football. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""Until Christmas, the size of the squad was too big and when you can only bring on three in every game, then you have some players who have almost no chance to get game time. They naturally won't feel like they are important in the squad, and that's the most frustrating thing that can happen. ""At times, the players or maybe even the people around them will put something out in the media. That's normal, it's not something unique for a club like Manchester United. ""But if you look at the top teams in Europe, England and abroad, they have 20 outfield players on around the same level, who could easily expect to play. If you are still competing in four competitions towards the end of a season, you need those 18, 20 players, two for each position, and you can rotate, plan ahead for the next three or four games."" So there is Rangnick's formula - right manager, right recruitment, right squad size. Could the glory days be heading back to Old Trafford sooner than we might think? It is clear from the candidness of our 20-minute interview that when he says it could, he truly means it. ""It all has to go hand in hand,"" he explains. ""It doesn't make sense if things are not co-ordinated with each other. If that happens, why should it take too long?""

In January 2019, though, it was Pep Guardiola's side who were the hunters in a role reversal to this season, when City led Liverpool by 14 points in mid-January, albeit having played two games more than their rivals. Back then, the Reds arrived in Eastlands holding a healthy seven-point lead after an unbeaten start to their Premier League campaign. In contrast the champions, as they were back then as well, had suffered a recent slip-up in their title defence, losing at Chelsea and Leicester City and surprisingly 3-2 at home to Crystal Palace in December to seemingly had the title initiative to Liverpool. All of which meant it really was a case of win or bust for City when they hosted the leaders on January 3 in front of an expectant audience on Sky Sports - ring any bells? - and boy did the contest live up to all the pre-match hype. Incredibly, 18 of the 28 players who featured that Thursday night are still on the clubs' payrolls - and as a sign of just how settled a unit Liverpool have been under Jurgen Klopp since then, the German could feasibly select nine of his XI that evening on Sunday. It could have been all 11 had Joel Matip and Fabinho, who are both likely to play this weekend, started. The game itself was packed full of drama, incident and intrigue, with the visitors somehow failing to take an 18th-minute lead after a lovely move involving Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino, who exchanged passes in a tight space inside City's half, before the former slipped Sadio Mane through on goal. Liverpool's Quadruple bid: How Klopp's side fare in historic challenge Man City vs Liverpool title race assessed Get NOW to stream big moments Premier League table The Senegal forward toe-poked his effort past the onrushing Ederson, only for his shot to strike the post, before John Stones's panicked clearance from the rebound hit his own 'keeper and looped goalwards as if in slow motion. Somehow, the City centre-half got back just in time to make a desperate clearance before Salah could tap into any empty net, with the technology revealing the ball was just 11.7mm away from crossing the whole of the goal line. Gary Neville, commentating on the match at the time for Sky Sports, simply said: ""Wow!"" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player That was not the only talking point of the clash, with Klopp furious City captain and central defender Vincent Kompany was not shown a straight red card after lunging in on Salah on the half-hour mark. ""I really like Vincent Kompany,"" Klopp told Sky Sports after the game. ""I really like him but how on earth is that not a red card? ""He's the last man, he goes in and if he hits Mo more he's out for the season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""A player goes to ground, and he took the risk. If Mo is on his feet, not jumping, then we all know what happen. ""He is still a really nice guy, he just made a really bad decision."" Of course, there was no Video Assistant Referee in operation that season - it was introduced the following campaign - with City going on to claim a crucial 2-1 victory thanks to Leroy Sane's winner 18 minutes from time after Firmino's close-range header (64) had cancelled out Sergio Aguero's opener five minutes before half-time. It was the first time in Guardiola's 97 Premier League matches in charge of City that his side had enjoyed less possession than their opponents, not that it mattered as the champions - in what their manager had labelled a ""must-win game"" - got the victory to cut Liverpool's lead to just four points. The breathtaking encounter, played in an ""atmosphere I've never heard before in this stadium,"" according to Neville, has since been held up as one of the finest of the Premier League era, while City's midfield trio of man-of-the-match Fernandinho, Bernardo Silva and David Silva were dubbed ""unreal"" by the Sky Sports pundit. Many forget, though, that City actually then suffered a shock 2-1 loss at struggling Newcastle United at the end of January to seemingly hand the title initiative straight back to Liverpool, only for the Reds themselves to fail to capitalise after being held 1-1 at home by Leicester City the following night. City right-back Kyle Walker even mocked his rivals, writing in a tweet that he later deleted: ""So basically they thought they were going to go 7 points ahead….,"" with the Etihad win serving to breathe new life into the champions' faltering title defence as they went on to win 14 straight league games after their St James' loss, while at the same time seeming to unnerve their rivals. And to show just how key that meeting was in determining the outcome of the 2018-19 title race, Klopp was still referencing Stones's goal-line clearance even three years later. ""You can say a point, but for me, it was 11mm,"" said the Liverpool boss when asked last December what had decided that season's Premier League. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  After dropping points to Leicester, Liverpool were also then held at West Ham United at the start of February, before back-to-back goalless away draws with arch-rivals Manchester United and Everton - who they also face in this season's run-in - left the outcome of the title back in City's own hands. A seemingly insurmountable seven-point advantage at the turn of the year had, just two months later, turned into a one-point lead for City with nine games left to play as too many draws ultimately hurt the Reds' challenge. Interestingly, Liverpool drew seven times that season compared to City's two, while this time around the Reds have been held on six occasions - two more than the champions have. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  However, Klopp's side have not drawn since adding to their attacking options with the £37m acquisition of Luis Diaz at the end of January, winning every league game since, in what could yet prove to be the major difference to them getting over the line come May. Three years ago both teams were perfect down the final stretch, winning their last nine league games. In fact, the current league table is virtually a replica of how it looked at the corresponding stage in 2018-19 as the two rivals now prepare for their final eight-match stretch - although Sunday's showdown means both cannot go on a winning run from now until the end of the campaign. And just like three years ago, you also get the feeling the winner on Sunday will again take all the spoils come the season finale on May 22. In a special edition of the Essential Football Podcast, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher joins Ron Walker to discuss this weekend's crunch title-race clash as leaders Manchester City host second-placed Liverpool live on Sky Sports Premier League this Sunday.

Arsenal were catching us up. And their team was good enough to go above us, there was no question about that.” Sir Alex Ferguson was reflecting on what many regard as the seminal rivalry of the Premier League era. Arsene Wenger won the Premier League three times in his first eight seasons in English football. It was Ferguson's Manchester United that claimed the rest. The 1999 treble-winning campaign came immediately after Wenger's first title. It was the emergence of that Arsenal team that made his Manchester United better. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Yet, throughout that period, there was never a season in which both sides hit the 80-point mark. In fact, United and Arsenal have only done that once in Premier League history - the year after Thierry Henry left when the Gunners finished third behind Chelsea. The sort of sustained excellence now being served up by Manchester City and Liverpool is unprecedented. There is an argument that it is now the greatest Premier League rivalry. Some will point to the greater wealth disparity that exists now but that is only a partial explanation - it does not account for the gulf they have opened up on other elite clubs. Since the summer of 2018, the overall points totals for Manchester City and Liverpool stand at 338 and 337 respectively. The next team on that list is Chelsea - 73 points behind. Get Sky Sports Live football on Sky Premier League table Premier League fixtures The gap was 25 points to third in the epic 2018/19 title race and 15 points when Liverpool won rather more comfortably in 2020/21. The lead to the rest is already 10 points this season and likely to widen as they go into the run-in knowing any slip will be costly. As it stands, Liverpool are on course for the second-highest points total by a team finishing second in Premier League history - behind their outrageous total of 97 points in 2018/19. ""In the last four seasons - we were not around one year because of our problems and we had some struggles - but before it was an insane race,"" said Jurgen Klopp recently. Jamie Carragher has stated that these are two of the best teams in Premier League history - and the best two teams in Europe right now - and it is difficult to disagree. Liverpool did not win the Premier League title in 2019 - they had to settle for the Champions League - but their relentless pursuit of Manchester City demanded that Pep Guardiola's team won their final 14 games to claim the title. Somehow they did it. They are pushing each other to heights they could not reach alone. The two-time Olympic decathlon champion Daley Thompson once famously said that he trained twice on Christmas Day precisely because his rivals might only train once and it would give him the edge. Across sport there are examples of rivalry pushing people on. Pete Sampras, the 14-time grand slam winning tennis player, said that Andre Agassi forced him to become better. The tryptic of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic have since driven each other on to a level of excellence never before seen in the men's game. ""I am sure Roger and Novak have made me a better player,"" said Nadal. ""And I made them better."" If there is one thing that has been lacking from that three-way tennis rivalry it has been personal animosity. Diametrically opposed characters can give a rivalry its edge. It is why some in that sport miss the theatre of the Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe rivalry. In the Premier League, the Manchester City and Liverpool era has not had Cesc Fabregas throwing pizzas, Martin Keown screaming in Ruud van Nistelrooy's face or anything like the tunnel bust-up between Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane to capture the imagination. ""It became toxic for a while,"" said Ferguson. This is a rivalry that has elevated both parties rather than exploded. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Guardiola knows that rivalries can become toxic. He experienced that in La Liga when Jose Mourinho's jibes culminated in a physical confrontation between the then Real Madrid coach and Guardiola's assistant Tito Vilanova. This challenge has been on the pitch. ""Liverpool are the toughest opponent I have ever faced in my 12 or 13 years as a manager,"" said Guardiola. ""Hopefully we can say we are a pain in the arse for Liverpool too."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Klopp agrees. ""That's a good description and that is how it should be,"" says the Liverpool boss. ""We are pushing each other and that is how it is and it keeps you going. There is no chance to get a bit soft because the other one will be there immediately to catch you."" Whether Manchester City versus Liverpool on Sunday will provide the off-field drama and narrative arcs that mark out the game's greatest ever rivalries cannot be guaranteed. But on the pitch itself, the Premier League may never have had two better teams. In a special edition of the Essential Football Podcast, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher joins Ron Walker to discuss this weekend's crunch title-race clash as leaders Manchester City host second-placed Liverpool live on Sky Sports Premier League this Sunday. Carra explains why the game may still not act as the title decider even with so little of the season left, why City and Liverpool have the edge in different parts of the pitch, why a draw might be a good result for both managers - and predicts how the Etihad showdown is going to go. Manchester City's huge Premier League clash against Liverpool takes place on Super Sunday, live on Sky Sports. With just one point currently separating champions City and Liverpool at the top of the table, the outcome is likely to have major implications for the title race. Coverage at the Etihad Stadium starts at 4pm on Sky Sports Premier League & Main Event, with kick-off at 4.30pm.

Liverpool trail the Premier League champions by just a point with now only eight fixtures left this season, starting with this weekend's potential title decider at the Etihad. However, the Reds travel to Eastlands with question marks hanging over Salah, who despite topping the Premier League scoring charts, having netted 20 times in 28 games so far this season, has nonetheless looked jaded and off colour in recent weeks. Salah has still to agree a new contract at Anfield, even though his current deal runs out in the summer of 2023, while he also recently suffered the double heartbreak of his country losing the final of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCONs) on penalties to Senegal and then failing to qualify for this year's World Cup. All of which has led to much uncertainty of late regarding Salah's future on Merseyside and, combined with a relative loss of form in front of goal, means all eyes will be on the player on Super Sunday. So, should Liverpool fans be worried? When Salah waltzed through Chelsea's normally impregnable back-line to score yet another Goal of the Season contender at Stamford Bridge at the turn of the year, there were few forwards in world football who could reasonably claim to be his equal. Liverpool fixtures Get NOW to stream big moments Premier League table Get Sky Sports Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The 29-year-old had enjoyed a spectacular first half to the season, becoming the first Liverpool player to find the net 10 games in a row when scoring a hat-trick in his side's 5-0 romp at Manchester United in October. Salah also brought up his century of league goals for the Reds, doing so in fewer games - 151 - than any other player at the club as he headed off to the AFCONs in early January in rude health. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  However, since returning from the tournament at the start of February, it has all seemed a bit of a struggle for Salah, who did score five goals in 10 games heading into March's international break - but three of those were penalties, while, incredibly, the normally razor-sharp frontman has not found the back of the net in open play since Liverpool beat Norwich on February 19. Not only that, but Klopp has also hooked his star man after 69 and 61 minutes in each of Liverpool's last two matches against Watford and Benfica respectively, when his usually immaculate first touch was anything but. Klopp, though, is adamant there is nothing to worry about with Salah, who is just going through a blip after an arduous recent workload for both club and country, ""He might not have scored from open play or whatever, maybe a penalty here or there, that's not too important,"" Klopp said recently when quizzed about Salah's form. ""The performance level is important for me, the threat he is for other teams. How he brings players together in moments when he gets the ball, maybe two or three players are going for him in these moments. ""Sometimes he could decide in a better way, no doubt about that, pass the ball quicker and all these things. But it's a tough period for Sadio (Mane) and Mo, with the Africa Cup and coming back being immediately available for us again with all the games."" One thing that cannot be denied, though, is Salah does have a lot of miles in his legs at this stage of the season. The forward, who is rarely injured, has played in 28 of Liverpool's 30 Premier League games so far this season, while he has also featured in all nine of their Champions League ties, as well as their League Cup final win over Chelsea, totalling 3,156 minutes. However, that does not take into account his appearances for Egypt, who he has represented in both AFCON games and World Cup qualifiers this year. In fact, Salah has been involved in games for Liverpool and Egypt that have gone to extra-time on six occasions already in 2022, which surely goes some way in explaining his slightly leggy appearance of late. Analysis by Sky Sports data journalist Adam Smith: Pinpointing Liverpool's resurgence is often narrowed down to the arrival of Klopp and the signings of Virgil van Dijk and Alisson, but there is also a case for Salah. Joining the Reds for £39.5m in the summer of 2017, they proceeded to secure a second-successive top-four finish and reached the Champions League final that season. Since making his debut for the club, Salah has scored 115 Premier League goals - some 15 more than runner-up Harry Kane. Meanwhile, only three players have carved more assists: Kevin De Bruyne and team-mates Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson, who also became first-team regulars during Salah's maiden campaign at Anfield. The Egyptian continues to dominate the charts, too. This season, Salah leads the way once again with 20 league goals and is merely one shy of Alexander-Arnold atop the assist rankings. What makes his returns even more special is how they have been achieved by a player primarily stationed down the right flank. The 29-year-old has effectively coined the titular title for a modern inverted forward: the Salah role. Salah is notoriously robust and has only missed a starting berth on 18 occasions out of a possible 182 Premier League games since joining the club. This term, commitments with Egypt at the AFCONs mean he has now started 35 games for club and country in all competitions, and there has been a drop-off. Salah was averaging at 0.71 non-penalty goals per game until early December but that ratio has slumped threefold to just 0.21 since. An identical decline applies to assists. However, his expected returns in both these metrics have remained constant or actually improved, suggesting his clinical edge has waned since the festive period. Salah's rolling five-game average for non-penalty goals per game has hit rock-bottom for the first time this season, but a blip is hardly cause for concern after such a blistering start to the campaign and you would not bet against him returning to form at the Etihad this weekend. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  All of which means Klopp now has a huge dilemma for Sunday's showdown at the Etihad - stick with his misfiring forward, or bench him and go with his more in-form frontmen? Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge thinks Salah should start the game on the bench. ""If you're going by form, Mo wouldn't get in the team,"" he told Sky Sports. ""As good as he is, as great as he is, as much as we love him, on present form he's struggling. ""People might say he's had his head turned but his contract situation doesn't help. He hasn't scored from open play for six weeks and he's just not himself on the pitch. ""I don't know why that reason is but come Sunday if he's on the pitch, we need him like never before. It's the biggest game of the season by far. We need him to be at his best on Sunday."" Klopp does now have more attacking options at his disposal following the additions of Diogo Jota and Luis Diaz, meaning he could feasibly start Sunday's title decider without the top scorer in the Premier League, although it would still represent a massive gamble on his part.

Arsenal's top-four bid over?,"This high-stakes clash was the polar opposite of the encounter between Liverpool and Manchester's other club this weekend. Man City vs Liverpool represents a meeting of two of the game's greatest minds, a masterpiece between the league's title protagonists in a class of their own. By contrast, Goodison Park hosted a festival of the doomed involving two clubs in desperate need of a reset. But Everton are not dead. This was a step in the right direction. It was this month three years ago that they produced arguably their best performance of the Farhad Moshiri era against Manchester United, outclassing them 4-0 to provoke a memorable rebuke from Gary Neville. The defeat exposed all the problems facing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. A fifth successive away defeat for the first time since 1981 would contribute to their failure to qualify for the Champions League. ""I've often said that clubs over the last seven years, if you've got weeds in the garden, then you've got to get rid of them,"" said Neville. ""But there's some Japanese knotweed at that football club and it's attacking the foundations of the house. It needs dealing with properly."" Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments Premier League table Premier League fixtures So much has changed and yet so much has stayed the same at United, who look no closer to competing for the big prizes. Despite coming off in the 64th minute, Marcus Rashford attempted more shots at goal (3) and had more touches in the opposition's box (6) than any other player in the match. It is scant consolation for the disgruntled travelling fans but the forward looking a bit more like his old self is a small crumb of comfort that Rangnick can take with him back to Manchester.Ben Grounds Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Only a couple of weeks ago it felt as though Arsenal were favourites to land fourth place and a long-awaited return to the Champions League. But in the space of six days, their hopes of returning to Europe's top club competition have suffered a significant blow. The defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday Night Football was a bad one. Arsenal, harassed and harried by their London rivals, never got going and made costly mistakes. It was the worst performance they'd served up since the early weeks of the season. A young side is prone to inconsistency, though, and the real issue was not that loss but how they'd respond. The answer Arsenal fans saw on Saturday would have alarmed them. While Brighton didn't bring the same frantic pressing style to the Emirates that Palace showed at Selhurst Park, Arsenal were still slow out of the blocks again, sloppy in possession and disjointed in attack, with the forced reshuffle caused by Thomas Partey's absence and Nuno Tavares' form not working. Gabriel Martinelli was denied an equaliser by a marginal offside call on the stroke of half-time but that would have been harsh on Brighton. Arsenal laboured with the ball and lacked zip or a clear approach, as Mikel Arteta conceded afterwards. It wasn't until Martin Odegaard made it 2-1 in the 89th minute that Arsenal showed the required intensity levels. Twice this week Arsenal have passed up opportunities to go fourth. With injuries, fixtures and points totals now counting against them, Arsenal have it all to do if they are to now overhaul neighbours Tottenham. Come the summer, they may look back on this week as the moment their encouraging season unravelled.Peter Smith Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Heung-Min Son now has 17 Premier League goals this season and in this form might yet rival Mohamed Salah for the golden boot. That connection with Harry Kane looks as lethal as ever, with the England captain's assist for the third goal highlighting his extraordinary vision. But perhaps it is time we talked about this being a magical trio at Tottenham as well as a perfect partnership. Dejan Kulusevski raced through to score from another Kane assist and then turned provider for Son for the fourth goal. The Swede has been a revelation since his arrival. There is not much that Kane and Son lacked but he has added it. A natural left-footer, he knows when to slow the game down as well as speed it up, and that calmness in the final third sets him apart from the other contenders for that third position in the Tottenham attack. Gareth Bale's return to the club on loan from Real Madrid last season had briefly hinted at a dream team of a forward line - and the Welshman did deliver goals. But Kulusevski has been better. This time, it looks like it might be enough to carry Spurs into the Champions League places.Adam Bate Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Within 21 minutes at St Mary's, Chelsea had delivered the response needed of them after two damaging defeats. Marcos Alonso, Mason Mount and Timo Werner had all struck to quickly lay any concerns to rest having been stunned by Brentford 4-1 a week ago and then humbled 3-1 at home by Real Madrid. Thomas Tuchel made four changes from their Champions League quarter-final first-leg defeat with Mateo Kovacic, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Timo Werner and Marcos Alonso all put into the team. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The switches helped Chelsea be more aggressive against a Southampton side known for their tenacity. It meant when Chelsea won the ball back quickly, they could counter-attack immediately and capitalise on the space in behind the Southampton defence. The Blues were so good at hustling the Saints midfield that the combative Oriol Romeu was hooked after just 35 minutes having been thoroughly overrun. Kovacic and Ngolo Kante were relentless in their pressure while Loftus-Cheek, despite playing out of position at right-wing back, played a crucial part in Chelsea's physicality, but also in attack by being involved in two goals. Alonso, too, also delivered the important opener with a trademark arrival into the box. Then there was Werner who showed his value after being benched against Madrid with two goals from enough chances to score five, not that it mattered in the end because Chelsea found their sting again.David Richardson Referee Jon Moss finally consented to the baying home crowd. Everton don't know how to win, according to Sean Dyche, but they found a way to hold on despite Manchester United's best efforts to go quietly. This is a poor United side and this abject display spearheaded by the anonymous Cristiano Ronaldo laid bare the size of the task facing Erik ten Hag if he is appointed. But the day and this occasion was about Everton. Richarlison, the tireless Brazilian, embodied Frank Lampard's calls for energy and fight for the cause in response to the second-half capitulation at Burnley. There were Herculean efforts by all those in blue, from Alex Iwobi and Fabián Delph - the unlikely couple - in midfield and of course from Gordon, who has the footballing world at his feet. Jordan Pickford was no bystander, playing his part to twice deny Marcus Rashford and then Ronaldo in stoppage time. This was a backs-to-the-wall performance from Everton, another twist at the bottom and another twist of the knife in United's Champions League hopes. ""I've got to give the lads a lot of credit here having lost twice in a week,"" Frank Lampard said. ""To go again Saturday morning against a team that's fresh and full of quality was excellent. It was joined-up with the fans, it's been good here since I've arrived by that's not a given. The players put the effort in. We've been due one of those, a deflection, something to hang onto. ""I'm pleased for Anthony. He feels it, he's grown up here and he's mature beyond his age. No wonder the fans love him. It's always a team effort and Jordan made two big saves in the first half and an outstanding one at the end. It felt outstanding. His quality makes the save. Jordan is England's No 1 for a reason and he absolutely showed it today."" ""We know it's in our hands, regardless of the others, to stay in the league. Some people around me have been calculating how many more points or wins we need but I'm not focused on that. We just need to keep performing like this."" The Spirit of the Blues plays out and they have never shown so much spirit this season.Ben Grounds ""He's a class act,"" Jamie Carragher said of Bruno Guimaraes after he produced a man-of-the-match display in Newcastle's 1-0 win over Wolves on Friday Night Football. The more the Brazilian plays, the more there is to admire about him. On his first home Premier League start for the Magpies since arriving from Lyon for £40m in January, the midfielder oozed quality from the first minute at St James' Park before he left the pitch to a standing ovation shortly before the final whistle. The 24-year-old's exquisite backheel volley against Southampton last month showed he possesses world-class attributes and he proved once again why Newcastle made him their most expensive signing so far under new ownership. Completing 37 of 41 passes, winning possession seven times and making four tackles, it was a dominant performance against a Wolves outfit who went into the game still with an outside chance of qualifying for next season's Champions League. Newcastle boss Eddie Howe told Sky Sports Guimaraes gives his side a ""different dimension"". His South American flair does exactly that, but he also has a strong work ethic and combative attitude. Despite last weekend's 5-1 defeat at Tottenham, Newcastle have been transformed under Howe and are now 10 points clear of the relegation zone. They are almost certain to become the first team to avoid the drop after failing to win any of their first 14 games. With safety almost secured, they can now afford to have one eye on building towards what they hope will be an exciting future. Guimaraes is certain to play a starring role.Dan Sansom Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Bruno Lage described Wolves' 1-0 defeat to Newcastle on Friday Night Football as an opportunity missed for his side in their push for European football and it is hard to disagree with him. It was an abysmal first-half display, which Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher said could only get better after the break, but there was minimal improvement in the second 45 minutes. Wolves' approach to sit back and soak up the Newcastle pressure worked for large parts of the first half, but they offered nothing going forward and failed to register a single shot on target until the 81st minute. The absences of Ruben Neves and Leander Dendoncker were sorely felt in midfield with teenager Luke Cundle, making just his second Premier League start, struggling to get to grips with the game as Newcastle's £40m January signing Bruno Guimaraes ran riot. It's a case of 'what if' again for Wolves fans, who will be wondering why their team failed to turn up at St James' Park when a win would have moved them to within two points of fourth-placed Tottenham and up to sixth, albeit momentarily.Zinny Boswell Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  There was no sugar coating Roy Hodgson's assessment of Watford's survival hopes after their latest setback at the hands of Leeds. ""We have no reason to be confident,"" the former England boss said after watching his team succumb to a ninth successive Premier League defeat at Vicarage Road. The Hornets became the first Premier League side in a decade to match that unwanted record. The last team to do so, Wolves, were relegated, and it's becoming increasing difficult to see how Hodgson can turn things around and avoid what would be the first top-flight relegation of his illustrious career. As the unlikelihood of Watford hauling themselves out of the mess they find themselves in increases, so too does the improbability of Leeds surrendering the healthy position they have battled themselves into under Jesse Marsch. Three wins in a four-game unbeaten run have transformed the fortunes of the Yorkshire club, who were once staring at the plight now engulfing Watford. Marsch has galvanised a group of players many feared would struggle to adapt to methods other than those of predecessor Marcelo Bielsa. Such fears look incredibly misguided now, with Marsch having surely guided Leeds to another season in the Premier League.Jack Wilkinson Another Saturday, another chance to win £250,000 with Super 6.

Sources from Ajax and the Dutchman's camp told Sky Sports News last week talks over compensation and how to handle a formal announcement had taken place, after he impressed in his interview. United denied having official discussions and called such an advanced reading of the situation ""premature"". The club have stuck to that line, insisting no deal has been done with anyone. United's position is also that the process is still underway with multiple candidates, and they will not be providing running commentary on it. Ten Hag has a year left on his Ajax contract but excellent relations between the clubs have made talks more straightforward and the Eredivisie club will not stand in his way. He has long been admired internally, is the popular candidate, and was the easiest to secure on their shortlist of four. Mauricio Pochettino has been his only true rival for the job, but negotiating with Paris Saint-Germain would be an altogether different prospect than dealing with Ajax. The Dutch club have been helpful rather than obstructive and it is understood Ten Hag's compensation price is a lowly £1.7m compared to £15m for the Argentine.

Football director John Murtough and technical director Darren Fletcher led the search for a new manager, feeding into chief executive Richard Arnold and joint-chairman Joel Glazer. The latter pair have understood to have plumped for Ten Hag over Pochettino, who twice before had been the club's favoured choice to take charge. United insist no appointment is imminent. Sky Sports News' senior reporter Melissa Reddy: Manchester United's interest in Erik ten Hag will come as no surprise given his status as one of the most progressive coaches in Europe, and his long links to their managerial vacancy. The 52-year-old has had admirers at Old Trafford stretching back to 2018/19, when his Ajax side knocked out Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, before then stunning Juventus and only being denied a place in the final after Lucas Moura's last-minute goal for Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ten Hag is a popular choice to take charge at Old Trafford and represents what is seen as a ""fresh, exciting future"", although there is an acceptance risk is involved as it would be a sizeable leap for him. The last highly-successful Ajax coach to move to England's top flight - via Inter - was Frank de Boer, who lasted just 77 days at Crystal Palace. The expectations, global glare placed on United, and level of competition at the top end of the Premier League is like nothing he would have previously experienced. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Gary Neville: ""Ten Hag worked in Bayern Munich when Pep Guardiola was there. We know the impact that had. He's won a couple of titles and cups in Holland. His style of play is good. He's got more experience than I think most people think at the age of 52. ""It's a massive jump but he's got a good coaching pedigree. He's not scarred and that's a good thing - he comes in fresh. I did a poll the other day and I was absolutely stunned - 240,000 people voted and 82 per cent were in favour of bringing him in over (Mauricio) Pochettino. ""I knew that he would be favourite because you can smell it on social media. I think Manchester United fans are demanding a fresh start and a fresh name. They want something that's completely different that they've not had before, and that's probably gone against Pochettino in some ways."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Dutch football journalist Marcel van der Kraan: ""Ajax fans are almost getting desperate, hoping that their club would at least make an attempt to keep him but the closure to Manchester United is getting smaller and smaller - and they expect him to leave. ""But the deal is not done yet. Erik ten Hag wants two guarantees: one of them is a backroom staff which will fit him and which will fit United. This will be good for him in changing the club's philosophy and its identity. ""The other one is freedom with his management of players. There are players who are older and there are those with massive experience like Cristiano Ronaldo but what happens if he wants to change to a playing style which suits younger players like he did at Ajax? ""I can very much see Steve McClaren going back to United and working with him. Ten Hag was an assistant of McClaren at FC Twente [in 2008/09] but he was a rapidly-developing coach back then. He relied on him massively because his tactics were brilliant and his ideas on coaching were great. ""Ten Hag needs somebody who knows the set-up, the Premier League and every opponent inside-out. Because the relationship was so good, he would not be against taking McClaren on. ""There would be a big change in style of play. We have to look towards the other end of the city in Manchester. Ten Hag is probably the biggest fan in European football of Pep Guardiola. He doesn't copy his style but he loves his style - he worked with him at Bayern Munich and they discussed a lot about how they should play. ""He had to play in the same way with the reserves as the first team so those players could be ready when called upon by Guardiola. He's done the same style ever since with Ajax, home or away, Champions League or Eredivisie. It's all about 'Attack! Attack! Attack!' It's based on the Johan Cruyff philosophy of scoring one more goal than your opponent to win games. It's what he would bring in."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Wayne Rooney had tipped Pochettino to become the next Manchester United manager, believing his Premier League experience and history of blooding youth placed him ahead of Ten Hag. ""I think Pochettino has done it in the Premier League,"" Rooney said. ""He knows the Premier League and at Tottenham he brought a lot of players through. He did it at Southampton as well. ""If I'm choosing from one of the two, that's who I'd choose. He would need to be given time to place his blueprint on the club and on the team. If you give him time, I think he'd do well.""

After a protracted pursuit of the England international, the Old Trafford giants finally got their man after agreeing a £73m deal with Borussia Dortmund. Sancho looked a shell of the player that lit up the Bundesliga during the first part of this season, only for Rangnick's arrival to gradually bring about an uptick in performances and self-belief. The 21-year-old forward produced another impressive performance as United beat Tottenham 3-2 on Saturday evening and Rangnick is excited by his progress. ""They paid quite a few pounds for him in order to lure him away from Borussia Dortmund and if you pay that amount of money in a transfer fee for a player he should perform on this kind of level,"" Rangnick said. ""At the end, they are all human beings. The mere fact he cost a lot of money does not mean that he is playing at that level to start with. ""He told me that of course it was a problem for him to get adjusted to the intensity of the league, to the physicality of the league. Get Sky Sports Latest Premier League news Watch Premier League highlights Premier League top scorers & assisters ""Now he has managed to do that. I'm happy to see him play at that kind of level right now."" Rangnick said the winger ""is now getting closer to the Jadon Sancho I've known from Germany"", adding ""in the end it's all about confidence"". ""When I came here it was clear we had to try everything to help him to get the best version of himself,"" the interim boss added. ""And the same actually - I repeat myself - is true for a player like Marcus Rashford, for example."" Sancho has an ability to get fans on their feet and will likely have an important role to play in Tuesday's Champions League last-16 second leg against Atletico Madrid, as will Cristiano Ronaldo. The 37-year-old missed the humbling derby defeat at Manchester City with a hip flexor issue but returned with a bang on Saturday when scoring a hat-trick and leading from the front. ""He is an important player of course,"" Rangnick said. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""With his reputation and with the way he can still play he has influence on the team for sure but there are also other players in the team who have to take responsibility, who have to perform, who can be leaders of the team. ""He can be a leader with a performance like that. This is what I have been telling him since I arrived, that with a performance like [Saturday] he can be one of the engines of the team. ""But we have quite a few other players who can do the same, including Fred, Harry (Maguire), Rapha (Varane), Victor (Lindelof), whoever. ""Even Edi (Cavani) when he came on the last 10 or 15 minutes showed how important and what kind of role he can still play for the team. ""I wish him to be available until the end of the season. It was a big shame and also not good for our team to not have him available in the last six weeks."" Cavani should be available again when Atleti come to town, but Rangnick is unsure whether Scott McTominay will be back from a calf complaint. Luke Shaw should be available after Covid-19 but Bruno Fernandes ""will probably be a last-minute race"" having tested positive at a time of testing issues at the club. ""We have to be careful with Covid tests,"" Rangnick added. ""David (De Gea) was the same. ""David (on Friday) was out, he was not supposed to play but then it turned out that the first fast test was false. ""He took another one or two quick tests then a PCR test and that was negative.

After Harry Maguire's own goal saw Spurs equalise for the second time, Ronaldo had the final word as he completed a stunning hat-trick with a late towering header.

England are preparing for the winter World Cup in Qatar and have lined up two Wembley friendlies against Switzerland on March 26 and Ivory Coast on March 29. Kyle Walker is also out of the 25-man squad, with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold and Chelsea's Reece James preferred, but Gareth Southgate says the Manchester City right-back will return for the June internationals. Southgate says the form of others pushed Rashford and Sancho out of his squad, with Emile Smith Rowe, Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden, Raheem Sterling and Jack Grealish preferred in the attacking wide areas. Rashford, who was included in the squad in November, has been dropped after scoring just twice since then, and having been used largely as a substitute by United interim boss Ralf Rangnick since the turn of the year. Southgate said: ""It is a difficult time for [Rashford]. He's clearly not at his best. There's plenty of time, we know a lot about Marcus anyway and hopefully he can rediscover some of his form."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, Sancho misses out again despite being handed more playing time in recent weeks for United. Ramsdale or Pickford for England? England fixtures Live football on Sky Sports this week Find out more about Sky Sports Explaining Sancho's exclusion, Southgate said: ""Because with the other attacking players in the squad are slightly ahead of him in the moment in our feeling."" Guehi, who was signed from Chelsea in the summer, has impressed at Palace under Patrick Vieira on his debut Premier League season and has been promoted from the U21s. On the inclusion of Guehi, the England manager said: ""With Marc, he's had a really consistent season. I've been very impressed with him on and off the ball. In the biggest games, he's been very calm. ""We know a lot about him through our development teams as well - he's a junior World Cup winner - so there are some centre halves who are pushing and we're very close, but we've added Marc and Ben White this time and we think it's a good opportunity to see two slightly younger players and see how they cope being with us."" There are six players in the 25-man squad - Nick Pope, Guehi, James Ward-Prowse, Conor Gallagher, Smith Rowe, and Abraham - who were not involved in the Euros. There was no place in the squad for Crystal Palace forward Michael Olise, who has caught Southgate's eye this season, with big uncertainty about where his international future lies. The Hammersmith-born 20-year-old, who is eligible for four different nations, was on Friday called up for the France U21s for the first time, having represented them previously at U18 level. Goalkeepers: Jordan Pickford (Everton), Aaron Ramsdale (Arsenal), Nick Pope (Burnley) Defenders: Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Conor Coady (Wolves), Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace), Reece James (Chelsea), Harry Maguire (Manchester United), Tyrone Mings (Aston Villa), Luke Shaw (Manchester United), John Stones (Manchester City), Ben White (Arsenal) Midfielders: Jude Bellingham (Borussia Dortmund), Conor Gallagher (Crystal Palace), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Mason Mount (Chelsea), Declan Rice (West Ham), James Ward-Prowse (Southampton) Forwards: Tammy Abraham (Roma), Phil Foden (Manchester City), Jack Grealish (Manchester City), Harry Kane (Tottenham), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal), Emile Smith Rowe (Arsenal), Raheem Sterling (Manchester City) Sky Sports News' Rob Dorsett There are only two Manchester United players in the senior England squad of 25 - Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw. One is out of form, the other is not fully fit. It's an indictment of where United are as a team right now - without a trophy for their fifth successive season - that they are so under-represented in the England set up. The omission of Marcus Rashford was expected. He's enduring a very difficult period in his footballing career, where it just isn't working. Ralf Rangnick has recognised that - that's why the 24-year-old has started just three Premier League games in this calendar year, and scored just twice in four months. Jadon Sancho's omission is more of a surprise, because Southgate himself admitted his level of performances has improved considerably in recent times. Two goals and three assists in six Premier League games attests to that. But Southgate was pointed in saying Sancho's level still is not good enough to make his squad of 25. He is right. Sancho is competing directly with Phil Foden, Raheem Sterling, Bukayo Saka, Jack Grealish and Emile Smith Rowe. Which of those five players is Sancho ahead of? None, according to the England boss. So even though Sancho is performing well enough be a regular, and one of the best players currently, at Manchester United - he is not playing well enough to be one of England's best five. Harry Maguire's inclusion in this squad is much more about his reliability for England in the past, rather than his form for United currently. Southgate admitted as much. He also said selection can never be a fully objective decision. While he always tries to select players who are most in-form for their clubs, the national manager cannot be held to ransom in this regard, otherwise the England squad would have little consistently from one training camp to the next, and it would make it impossible to prepare a group of players for major tournaments. Remember, Southgate has only three training camps (about 30 full training days) between now and the start of the World Cup in Qatar in November. So Maguire keeps his place - even though there are significant numbers of English central defenders who are performing better in the Premier League right now: Eric Dier and Fikayo Tomori, neither of whom made this squad, are cases in point. Conor Coady, Ben White and Marc Guehi are similar examples, who will join up alongside Maguire on Tuesday. Shaw's inclusion on England's list is a symptom of the spate of injuries that have hit a host of other English left-backs. Ben Chilwell is out for the season, Kieran Trippier is still two months from training again, and Bukayo Saka is flying at right wing, and so is not a consideration at full-back. If Shaw cannot prove his fitness with United this weekend, or if his club physios feel he needs more rehabilitation, it wouldn't be a surprise if he were to withdraw from Southgate's squad. If that happens, it's now clear Crystal Palace's Tyrick Mitchell is first in line for a call up. But more to the point, that would mean Manchester United have just one single player in the senior men's England squad. That is almost unheard of. Sky Sports' Zinny Boswell on the Essential Football Podcast: ""He's definitely been the best English goalkeeper performing in the Premier League this season, but - and it's a big but - Jordan Pickford, despite the criticism he gets at Everton, has never let Gareth Southgate down. ""Before the Euros, there were a lot of question marks over whether he should play, but he was pretty spotless at that tournament. ""It would be a massive call if come Qatar, Southgate says 'on your bike' and puts Ramsdale in goal. Any mistake would just be magnified, and everyone would be asking where Pickford was. ""Saying that, I would just stress again that he's definitely been the best English goalkeeper this season, so it's certainly up for debate.""

The 24-year-old was finally called upon from the bench in the second half of Manchester United's 1-1 draw with Leicester after interim manager Ralf Rangnick opted to play Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes as strikers even with Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani both missing with illness and injury respectively. Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville described the omission of Rashford from the starting line-up as a ""real killer and tells us that Rangnick doesn't fancy him"". ""To play without a centre-forward at home against Leicester when he's had a couple of weeks break away is a big decision by Ralf Rangnick,"" added Neville. ""Rashford needs a new manager like you wouldn't believe. This is a real low for him."" Rashford was dealt another big blow last month when he missed out on being selected for the latest England squad for the first time in six years with eight months to go until the Qatar World Cup. This season has been his worst since bursting into the first team from the academy in 2016. Rashford had been on the right path to becoming a 30-goal forward after netting 22 times in all competitions in 2019-20 and following it up with 21 goals and 15 assists. Only United legends Norman Whiteside, George Best and Ryan Giggs reached 250 games for the club at a younger age than him. But his form began to tail off last season which culminated in a penalty miss during England's Euro 2020 final shootout defeat with Italy, and now, with only five goals and two assists this term, his position for both club and country has come under threat. Man Utd fixtures Get Sky Sports Latest Man Utd news Get NOW to stream big moments The football world is still waiting for the forward who rose to great heights as a teenager to start delivering on the big stage. So what has gone wrong for the Manchester United forward? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Rashford played through the pain barrier for the majority of last season after tearing a muscle in his left shoulder in November 2020. He delayed surgery on the injury, instead choosing to help United reach the Europa League final while also knowing England were heading into a major summer tournament. ""I've read some call me selfish for holding off getting the surgery this season but it was never about putting myself first and that's how we've reached this point, and something as a 23-year-old I've had to learn the hard way,"" he said. At times, painkilling injections were used on the injury which was causing restricted flexibility and strength thus affecting his speed. He was also managing a problem with his right foot after pulling ligaments in January 2021 against Manchester City. United were beaten in the Europa League final by Villarreal on May 26, with Rashford missing a gilt-edged chance in that defeat, before he joined up with the England squad for Euro 2020. While England prospered, the tournament could hardly have gone any worse for Rashford personally. He played only 83 minutes of England's seven games, culminating with a penalty miss in the final's shootout after he had been brought on in the final minute of extra time to take a spot-kick. The Wembley nightmare was a cruel end to a gruelling 59-game season, but perhaps the length of that season - and the reliance that United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer placed on him as the club's key goalscorer - inflicted the injury problems he began the current campaign with. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I've had a difficult season, I think that's clear for everyone to see and I probably went into that final with a lack of confidence,"" said Rashford in a message to supporters after he, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were racially abused on social media following the Euros final. ""I've always backed myself for a penalty but something didn't quite feel right."" Rashford had surgery on his shoulder in early August before scoring on his return to action the following month after coming on as a substitute in United's 4-2 defeat at Leicester as results and performances went from bad to worse under Solskjaer. Rashford started in United's next fixture - a 5-0 defeat at home to Liverpool - but was subbed after an hour. In Solskjaer's final match in charge of United three weeks later - a 4-1 loss at Watford - Rashford was hooked at half-time. England's Euros ended in disappointment for Rashford - but nobody saw such a full from grace at United coming, even though the shoulder surgery was always going to inflict some sort of setback. Rashford was United's main man on the left-wing last season - making 23 out of his 37 league appearances on that flank - but he has now lost that position. Part of the reason why Rashford has struggled to recapture his form at Old Trafford is the emergence of Sancho. Like Rashford, United's £73m summer signing also began the season in slow fashion but has now surged ahead of his England team-mate in the Old Trafford pecking order on the left. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sancho has three goals and three assists in eight matches across all competitions and with Rashford registering just one assist and no goals in that time, the former has firmly made the left-wing position his own. The former Borussia Dortmund winger has been given far more opportunities by United interim manager Rangnick in recent weeks and it's easy to see why. Sancho has shown a better all-round game than Rashford - and not just one in front of goal. The stats declare that Sancho is streets clear of Rashford in terms of creativity, delivery and working hard off the ball, so Rashford has had to settle for a spot on the right this season - a position he is far from used to. That right-wing role has simply not been working. The first reason for that is another new kid on the block in Anthony Elanga, who has taken on that position in several big games for United this season. The Swedish teenager replaced Rashford in the middle of United's Champions League last-16 first-leg tie away at Atletico Madrid - and took full advantage. United failed to register a single shot on target with Rashford on that side of the attack, but Elanga came on to latch onto Bruno Fernandes' through ball to net a result-saving equaliser. It was no surprise to see Elanga back in that right-wing role for the goalless draw to Watford three days later and the Manchester derby defeat to rivals City the following week. While the Swede failed to build on that Atletico result, Rashford returned to that position for the 3-2 victory over Tottenham - but didn't impress in that contest either. Overall, Rangnick has put Rashford on the right for six Premier League matches since he took over - more than any other position in United's attack for the England man - and it has resulted in just one goal, one assist, three chances created and zero completed crosses. Elanga, meanwhile, has performed just as well in that position in recent weeks and Ragnick feels the Swede is more settled in that role. Rashford, meanwhile, has given no impression that this is even close to his best position. But it doesn't take an experienced analyst to see Rashford's favoured position is on the left or through the middle. In fact, the United winger admitted that himself in an interview last year. ""When you are on the left, you can create a lot more things on your own, giving that little bit more to the team,"" he said. ""To be honest, it does feel natural to be playing in the position that I'm playing now - I'm in the middle between the left and centre-forward - and it's definitely positive."" Sancho being left out by Southgate highlights how far Rashford has fallen behind. Rashford is second choice for the left-wing role at club level yet his first-choice team-mate can't make the England squad either. Competition for places at the top end of the pitch for England is fierce with plenty of options available. ""It's a difficult time for him, he's clearly not at his best but there's plenty of time,"" said Southgate on Rashford's struggles. Southgate's latest 25-man squad didn't include the injured Jarrod Bowen, who many expected to receive his first international call-up off the back of his eight goals and eight assists for West Ham this season. Bukayo Saka was an obvious pick having starred for Arsenal at right-wing after impressing Southgate at Euro 2020. Phil Foden is also seen as one of Southgate's future stars with his versatility across the front line a useful asset in international football although he's featured predominately on the left for City this season. Raheem Sterling, despite a quieter season, has become an England talisman in recent years and is one of the first names on the list. Incredibly, Jack Grealish is the only England forward option Rashford has outperformed in terms of goals and assists so far this season. But Grealish remains high for chances created from open play with only Bruno Fernandes bettering him. Grealish is a different type of winger to Rashford, who is more suited to using his pace on counter-attacks. Southgate, at this moment, may feel Grealish's outstanding ability to dribble with the ball at defenders is better suited for England to unlock stubborn opposition. Either way, Rashford has a lot of ground to make up in the next eight months.

""It has to do with rhythm and confidence, it's our job to help him to get this confidence back. ""The only thing we can do is speak to him regularly and tell him what we expect from him and what he should do. The rest has to be done by himself."" On the decision not to start him against Leicester, Rangnick said: ""The only one [striker] we had was Marcus Rashford. We knew this morning Cristiano could not play and decided to start Paul Pogba. After 60 minutes we made the change and had a central striker on the pitch. ""It is no secret that he was not full of confidence in the last couple of weeks.

On Saturday Night Football, he said: ""I'm looking at Rashford now and this is a young man who I believe has to go and explore and do something else.

He has had enormous success against the likes of Paris Saint-Germain in Europe, clubs in England would want him - Tottenham, Arsenal. ""But I think his time has run now at Man Utd."" But former Man Utd striker Andrew Cole has backed Rashford to come good again. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""It is a strange one, I saw the manager came out yesterday (Saturday) and said he had trained well the past couple of weeks, but it was a straight decision between him and Paul Pogba,"" he said on Super Sunday. ""Now if Pogba and Rashford cannot get into that Man Utd team, then they do have problems. We all go through a lack of confidence when we play football, and the only way to get it back is to play games. ""Marcus's form has been very up and down and you are at the stage where you could say he needs an arm around the shoulder, sit him down, talk to him and find out exactly what is going on - because there is no way he can get into the team at the age he did and then all that talent disappears. ""Confidence is a big thing and then once he gets that back, he will start proving himself once again."" Within 24 hours of Manchester United's humbling 4-1 defeat to rivals City in early March, Rashford, who came off the bench as a second-half substitute, was being linked with a summer move to Barcelona. Elanga started ahead of Rashford in the derby which led to reports the forward is unhappy with his playing time and is considering his future at United. Rashford also issued a passionate statement in response to a video posted on social media showing him reacting to hecklers outside of Old Trafford filmed after Man Utd's Champions League exit at the hands of Atletico Madrid. Rashford's current deal - a four-year extension he signed in July 2019 - expires in the summer of 2023. Clubs will be circling at the end of this season in a bid to sign him at a knock-down price if reports are true about his current stance, although United do have the option of extending his contract by an additional year. Rashford, a product of the United academy, will be loath to leave his boyhood club, but the draw of Barcelona or even PSG could tempt him away while Arsenal are also reportedly interested in signing him. However, if the ageing Cristiano Ronaldo and Cavani, 37 and 35 respectively, were to leave the club this summer then Rashford could be seen as the man to fill the striker position under the club's new manager. Rashford leaving United is a scenario Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson believes simply cannot come to fruition, irrespective of the player's recent struggles. ""It's been two or three months and there is talk of Rashford being moved on. Seriously?"" Merson said. ""No manager in their right mind would come to Old Trafford and offload Rashford. Even if I was going to take over the club as manager tomorrow morning, I wouldn't be letting Rashford go! ""This is why Manchester United are in a shambles, how haven't they got a manager in place now. Whoever does come in as manager isn't going to get rid of Rashford, so the move will have to be done before then, that's if it is going happen."" Gary Neville reckons it is best for Rashford to revaluate his situation at United once the season has come to an end. ""I do feel like Marcus Rashford needs to just go away this summer for a few weeks where he reassesses himself, what he wants from life and who he wants around him,"" he told Sky Sports. ""He's not playing with freedom at this time. I'd hate to think that from an academy player at the age of nine that has got great talent, would just leave after his first bad period, even if it has been 12 or 18 months now.""

Derby manager Rooney believes the new manager must overhaul the squad this summer, claiming the departures of Paul Pogba and Cristiano Ronaldo should be part of the upcoming rebuild. The exit from Europe last month means the club are suffering their worst trophy drought in 40 years with United's last piece of silverware being the Europa League triumph in 2017 under Jose Mourinho. Speaking on Monday Night Football, Rooney covered a range of issues engulfing his former club at a time when United are still challenging to qualify for next season's Champions League... ""It's been a strange season,"" Rooney told Sky Sports. ""I've been to the ground to watch them live a few times and they look like a team of individuals. When they make a mistake it always looks very difficult for them to recover as a team. ""I can look at it and say it hasn't been good enough as we have that group of players they need to be doing better. They're going through a tough time as a club, and I think what everyone wants is for them to get the manager situation sorted as soon as possible, and they have to rebuild for the next two or three years to make sure they're challenging again."" Rangnick has suggested it could take 18 months or ""two or three transfer windows"" before United can challenge for the Premier League title again.

For Manchester United not to be challenging, I think they'd want the season to stop now and forget about the Champions League. They're not going to compete in the competition as it stands even if they qualified for it. ""They have to rebuild the squad and everything around the first team and the club to make sure they put themselves in a position in two or three years' time where they can actually go and challenge again for the Premier League."" There has been plenty of speculation over who should take over at Old Trafford. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ten Hag has refused to rule out the possibility of joining United and added that he hopes Ajax will understand if he decides to take the ""next step"" in his managerial career. It has also been reported that United have sounded out Pochettino about becoming the club's next boss. Rooney believes Pochettino is better suited to taking over in the dugout when comparing the Paris Saint-Germain boss with Ten Hag. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""I think Pochettino has done it in the Premier League,"" Rooney said. ""He knows the Premier League and at Tottenham he brought a lot of players through. He did it at Southampton as well. ""If I'm choosing from one of the two, that's who I'd choose. He would need to be given time to place his blueprint on the club and on the team. If you give him time, I think he'd do well."" Pogba's contract expires at the end of the season and he looks set to lead a long list of departures at the club in the coming months. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Rooney stressed he would not stand in the Frenchman's way. ""I think it's got to a point where it's probably better for him to move on. If Paul is honest with himself, he probably hasn't had the impact he'd have liked since he returned to Manchester United,"" he said. ""I watch him for France and he's a completely different player. The ability, vision and control of the game is always there for France. It hasn't quite worked at United for him, and there's a few players they need to let go of. ""There hasn't been a settled manager there since Sir Alex Ferguson so I think whoever comes in, they need to give them time to build relationships with players. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""They were going through a transition period [under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer] and it didn't work. It's obvious it didn't work with Ole in the end or with the manager now who's come in, so I think Pochettino is a top manager. He knows how to work with top-class players but also with young players. ""They need to get that blend right as they can't afford to fail again."" Ronaldo was labelled a ""genius"" by Roy Keane after his spectacular hat-trick inspired Manchester United to a vital 3-2 victory over top-four rivals Tottenham - but the Portuguese missed last weekend's draw with Leicester due to illness. Ronaldo is United's top goalscorer this term with 18 goals in all competitions but Rooney believes his return to Old Trafford has not been a success. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""You'd have to say no, at the minute,"" he told Sky Sports when asked if he had experienced the desired impact. ""He's scored important goals early on in the season in the Champions League and he's scored the hat-trick against Tottenham but I think if you're looking towards the future of the club, you have to go with younger, hungry players to lift United over the next two or three years. ""Cristiano is getting on a bit and he's certainly not the player he was when he was in his 20s and that happens. He's a goal threat but I think during the rest of the game, they need more."" With Pogba and Ronaldo already listed as players to be moved on, Rooney was asked if there were others who should now be deemed surplus to requirements in the squad. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""They've got good young players and I think (Jadon) Sancho will be better next year. Marcus (Rashford) will be better next year and they've got good young players. ""I think Jesse Lingard should be playing for them as he brings energy and quality. Scott McTominay has done well so they've got good young players. ""They just have to get them confident and believing they're good players performing at a better level. I'm sure the new manager will bring his own players in to try to get them rebuilding."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Harry Maguire has struggled for form with his club, leading to the United captain being jeered by England supporters on international duty, but Rooney leapt to the defence of the under-fire centre-back. ""I like Harry,"" the Derby boss continued. ""He hasn't been in his best form this season like a lot of players. When he plays for England, he looks like a world-class centre-back so a lot of it is confidence to get the feeling of winning again consistently. ""If United do that, I think Harry Maguire is a big part of it."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Rooney also reflected on the years of struggle for United since 2013, when Ferguson retired and the team won their last Premier League title... ""When Sir Alex retired, I think everyone knew it was going to be a very difficult job. David Moyes came in and it didn't work out and from then, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer… we've had good managers but Manchester United is a different club to many clubs around the world. It needs someone to come in with that time to get that club back to where it deserves to be. It's not going to happen if you keep changing manager every two years. ""Ferguson was like the godfather of the club, not just the players but the staff, the academy, he was on top of everything. When you lose someone like that from the club, someone else is coming in and it's a massive change. For David Moyes I always thought, 'this is an impossible job to come in and replace Alex Ferguson'. He signed for six years and they were trying to give him that time to do it but it didn't work out. ""When [Ferguson] left everyone at the club was quite down a little bit. Even though we won the Premier League in that season. The people in power and certainly the more senior players who were left at the club knew this was going to be a big challenge. ""I think the players could adjust to Louis van Gaal - it was tough because of how he worked - and then to Mourinho but the adjustment for all the staff and the academy… the distance between the academy and the first team and manager, especially under Mourinho was huge. It was almost like they didn't exist. Having that relationship with Sir Alex for 26 years and then almost not being allowed or anywhere near the first team, it was almost like there was a divorce between the first team and the academy. ""[Ferguson] is still involved in some way and you see him at the games and that naturally will bring a pressure to whatever manager goes in there. But if you want to manage Manchester United you have to do it your way and make the decisions."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Could Rooney eventually be a Manchester United manager himself? He believes so. And is also targeting the manager's job at his boyhood club Everton one day... ""There are two clubs: Everton and Manchester United. I'm an Everton fan, I was at Man Utd for 13 years. I feel if I keep doing what I'm doing, keep learning, keep improving, those two clubs one day in the future I'd love to go and manage. ""You've got to trust in yourself and believe in yourself. Of course there will be temptation there. There might be offers that come in and you think, 'I'm going to go for that'. But you need to be in the right place and I believe I'm in the right place. I'm developing as a manager, developing as a coach and I'm learning. ""I understand when Frank Lampard went to Chelsea, it's so difficult to say no. But when you go into one of these big clubs you need to make sure it's the right time and you're able to develop and take that club forward. ""I got approached by Everton to interview for the manager's job but I'm in a job, I'm still learning and I felt it wasn't the right time.""

It is understood that the 19-year-old will move to Anfield this summer on a five-year contract. Carvalho's current deal expires this summer and Fulham would be entitled to compensation set by a tribunal should the teenager join another English side at the end of that, while continental clubs would only need to pay a nominal fee. Reports suggest Carvalho has already undergone a medical with his current club's permission ahead of a transfer which would see Liverpool pay Fulham £5m plus add-ons.

The race for Champions League football was Arsenal's to lose. But as the Premier League enters its final six-week period, suddenly the picture looks very different. Two defeats in three Premier League games, including Monday night's horrific 3-0 defeat away at Crystal Palace leaves Mikel Arteta's side facing a real fight to get back into the top four. Now it's the Gunners' arch-rivals Tottenham - who are in form after three wins on the bounce - holding the coveted fourth spot which earns a seat at European football's top table next season. Arsenal do have the slight luxury of a game in hand over Spurs, though the task of going away to Chelsea later this month needing a win feels a lot less comfortable. That crucial match at Stamford Bridge on April 20 marks the beginning of a tricky run for the Gunners, with a home clash against Manchester United swiftly following that game in hand, before a trip to West Ham at the start of May. It has transformed Arsenal's next two matches - at home to Brighton and away at Southampton - into simply must-win fixtures. But the pressure, scrutiny and injury problems are beginning to mount, so how have the Gunners got into this sticky scenario? Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Monday evening's poor outing at Crystal Palace was a shock in terms of the formbook - but a closer look at Arsenal's recent performances implies this type of result was coming. Arsenal's fixtures Latest Arsenal news Premier League table Get Sky Sports Arteta's side failed to get going in a tough Selhurst Park atmosphere, with their first shot on target coming in the final kick of the opening half. Clinical finishing, particularly from open play, has been a concern for the Gunners in recent weeks. Their troubles are highlighted by the fact they have failed to score a single goal from non-set piece scenarios in their last four matches, dating back to March 6. Arsenal have averaged just 3.75 shots on target per game in their last four Premier League matches, so they are not making massive strides to actually test the opposition goalkeeper. This is despite them creating 52 overall shots in that period - only Tottenham and Brighton have managed more. This poor finishing was as clear as day against Palace. Within the space of a few second-half minutes, Emile Smith Rowe and Martin Odegaard missed clear-cut chances to haul Arsenal back into the contest at 2-0 down. The Eagles made them pay by adding a third through Wilfried Zaha's goal shortly afterwards. Arsenal have been guilty of making similar errors in the past. In one of their games in hand against Liverpool last month, Odegaard missed a glorious chance to give the Gunners the lead from Thiago's loose backpass - but failed to convert past goalkeeper Alisson. Minutes later, Diogo Jota gave Liverpool the lead and Jurgen Klopp's side ran out eventual 2-0 winners. And against Manchester City on New Year's Day, Gabriel Martinelli missed a major chance with the scores at 1-1. The importance of that missed opportunity grew in significance when Rodri scored in stoppage time to give City the win. Similar concerns were raised during Arsenal's 0-0 draw against Burnley, where Arteta's side failed to score from 75 per cent possession and 20 shots on goal. While this lack of profligacy can be put down to individual errors, it can be correlated to a lack of firepower up front. Arsenal failed to bring in a replacement for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the January transfer window, leaving just Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah as their only recognised forwards. Lacazette has shown this season that he can bring separate skills other than scoring goals in the centre-forward role. In the 10 league games after Aubameyang was stripped of the Gunners captaincy before his departure from the club, he netted three goals and added seven assists for Arteta's squad. But the Frenchman has mustered just four league goals this season, and half of them have come from the penalty spot. Arsenal are struggling to score goal-scoring chances and they do not have the central option to create chances from nothing - there remains a reliance on wide options top scorers Bukayo Saka and Smith Rowe - both aged 21 and under -- for attacking influence. Compare Arsenal's plight to Tottenham's flight in front of goal. No team has made more shots - either on or off target - than Antonio Conte's side since Arsenal last scored from open goal. Data also shows Spurs are creating better chances in front of goal in that same period. This attacking impetus shows why Spurs are threatening to steal a march on the top-four race - and why the north London pendulum is swinging again. To make matters worse for Arsenal, their injury issues are piling up during this crucial part of the season. The build-up to their Crystal Palace defeat on Monday was marred by an injury to left-back Kieran Tierney, with Arteta describing the setback as ""not positive"" with regards to the Scotland international returning in time for the season run-in. It meant 22-year-old full-back Nuno Tavares was drafted in as Tierney's replacement for just his seventh league start of the season, and his lack of minutes clearly showed as he was partly at fault for the Eagles' two first-half goals. Tavares was beaten at the back post by Joachim Andersen for Jean-Philippe Mateta's opener, while his inability to track Jordan Ayew's run allowed the Ghanaian to double Palace's advantage. He was hauled off at half-time by Arteta, who branded the decision as ""tactical"". The Portuguese full-back has endured some tough outings in an Arsenal shirt in recent months, particularly away from home. He showed similar levels of sloppiness in the defeat away at Everton in December, before being taken off after just 35 minutes for tactical reasons in the FA Cup loss at Nottingham Forest. The statistics show that while Tierney and Tavares' statistics are similar, the latter is sloppier defensively than the Scot, who will be a big miss should he be out for the rest of the season. Arsenal do have other options in that left-back role, including Cedric Soares and Granit Xhaka - but both were used in that role this time last year, and the Gunners' season fell apart. Arteta cannot risk that happening again, so a quick-fire solution is needed. In additional salt to the Gunners' wounds, Thomas Partey limped off after pulling a muscle in the build-up to Palace's third goal, with Arsenal's No 5 expected to be another significant absentee. The Ghana midfielder's absence at the start of this calendar year, due to Africa Cup of Nations duty and suspension, was another bleak period for the Gunners. In the four matches Partey missed in January, Arsenal failed to score a goal in that time. It was only when the midfielder emerged back again in the team in February Arteta's side started winning again. The latest Gunners injuries mean Arteta's thin, young squad - which was manufactured in that way as there was no European football to contend with this season - is now incredibly short. The substitutes' bench at Palace contained three academy products without a single minute of first-team action this season. The inexperience on the bench is likely to reappear between now and the end of May. ""It's what we have, it's the numbers that we have,"" Arteta said immediately after the Palace defeat. ""We've lost Kieran and we've lost Thomas now and that's it. ""With the players that we have we will keep trying like we have since the start of the season, but we never had a big squad so we can't find any excuses. Today we have to look at ourselves and I'm the first one because I repeat myself, it wasn't good enough."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Again, Arsenal's injury woes compare strikingly to Tottenham's fitness issues. Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son have appeared to avoid their annual 'winter injuries', while Cristian Romero and Eric Dier have returned from the sidelines in time for the run-in. It's not just good luck that has fallen Spurs' way. The white half of north London were more proactive in the January transfer market, bringing in Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski who have made Tottenham more ""complete"", according to Conte. Arsenal, on the other hand, stubbornly chose to not bring in anyone, including a centre-forward. Those January decisions could be crucial when determining which north London postcode hosts Champions League football next term. Challenging for Champions League has not been an ambition at the Emirates Stadium in the past two seasons, but Arteta may look at the last time Arsenal were involved in this race with concern. The 2018/19 season saw Unai Emery's Gunners lie on the brink of a top-four finish, with the club sitting in third spot in April of that season with just a handful of matches to go. But a horrendous run-in saw it all go awry - and a defeat to Palace started the end of season collapse. The 3-2 home loss to the Eagles in April was the start of a run of three straight league defeats for Arsenal, who then suddenly dropped out of the top four. A 1-1 home draw to Brighton - and a Europa League final loss to Chelsea saw those ambitions vanish for that season. Brighton, coincidentally, are Arsenal's opponents this weekend, with the Seagulls suffering from similar issues themselves. They have scored just one Premier League goal since February 12 - and failed to find the net from 29 shots on goal in their goalless draw with Norwich on Saturday. Win and the pressure mounts on Tottenham ahead of their Saturday Night Football clash at Aston Villa, live on Sky Sports. But another slip-up and the tensions that currently exist could mount again, and it could lead to troublesome consequences in their top-four battle.

The Gunners' top-four hopes took a significant dent at Palace, a result which leaves Tottenham in fourth place after the Premier League weekend. The Gunners do have a game in hand on their north London rivals but this was an out-of-character performance from Arteta's side, as first-half goals from Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew and a second-half Wilfried Zaha penalty handed fantastic Palace the points. Arteta, who was missing left-back Kieran Tierney with a knee injury picked up with Scotland after playing in both of their recent friendlies, criticised his team's performance, admitting they did not compete physically with Palace. He told Sky Sports: ""Congratulations to Palace for the game they played but we made it impossible for ourselves with the way we competed. ""You have to be physical and run and then you earn the right to play. We were really inconsistent on the ball and that is unacceptable. ""We were poor, especially in the first half. I apologise to our supporters. We didn't have the presence today or the composure to dominate the situation so that is what I'm most annoyed with. Some days you are not there and you are late all the time. They got on top of it and had a good atmosphere and we could not get out. Premier League table Premier League results Crystal Palace 3-0 Arsenal - Match report Watch Premier League highlights ""When we had the big chances we didn't score to give ourselves the best chance to get back in the game. First of all we need to put our hands up and get the criticism we deserve. Then we accept it, look ourselves in the mirror and look to the next game. This was not good enough. ""We have to face the challenge and the opportunity is in our hands. We have to be honest with ourselves and support each other. ""From the beginning we were not at the races. When you come here you have to compete, you have to win duels and second balls and be aggressive and we were none of those and on top of that we were really poor on the ball. ""We tried in the second half, we had three or four big chances but the only half chance they had they got a penalty. ""It is time to accept the criticism, put your hand up and apologise because this performance was not good enough for this club, and then react. When everything goes well everyone wants to be there and be supportive."" Arteta was asked if perhaps one of the reasons for the defeat was the pressure being applied to them by Tottenham in the top-four race. He replied: ""No, the pressure has been there the last seven or eight weeks. Today we didn't perform it's as simple as that. We were second best in every department it's as simple as that. We have a game in hand still. In the nine games a lot will happen. We have to focus on ourselves."" On Tierney's injury, Arteta admitted the situation did not look positive for the Scotland full-back. ""He came back from international duty and he felt something wrong in his knee,"" Arteta said. ""We scanned it and there is some damage there. ""He's seeing the specialist on Tuesday and hopefully we will know more but it's not looking good."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Wayne Rooney on Monday Night Football: ""Crystal Palace were excellent. The intensity of Conor Gallagher really rubs off on the other players and you saw a reaction from the others. I thought 3-0 was deserved if I'm honest. ""It could be a damaging result for Arsenal, but I'm sure Mikel Arteta will be working on a reaction and making sure this game is put to the back of their minds. ""They've got a lot of important games coming up and they're in pole position still. I just think they've got so many young players that this might hurt them. Tottenham have got a little bit more experience which could help them get over the line."" Jamie Carragher on Monday Night Football: ""It's a bad night for Arsenal - the way they've lost, not just the three points but I think it's very important they don't panic and there's no hysteria. They're still in a really good position - a better position than Tottenham and Manchester United. ""They've just won five games away from home on the bounce so you're talking about 15 points from 18 away from home. They'd have took that from the six games away from home. ""It was a bad one and the worry is that this could happen another two or three times. Other teams will take encouragement from the way Palace played. ""I think it'll be a really big boost for Tottenham and United tonight - not just Arsenal dropping points but the way that they've lost. It's important they don't panic."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Crystal Palace boss Patrick Vieira said: ""We played a really good game of football. We defended well and took our chances. We scored in important moments of the game. We needed a big team performance and we did it so we're really pleased. ""We wanted to put pressure on and the atmosphere in the stadium allowed us to take that kind of risk. We were really smart with the way we defended from the front and took the chances to score goals. ""This football club is all about supporting the team and when we are at home we really feel that.

Defeat in Europe means the earliest United can achieve silverware is by winning next season's League Cup final, which is due to take place on February 26, 2023. With 2017 the last time United won a major trophy, they are now on their longest drought in four decades. After victory in the 1977 FA Cup, they had to wait until 1983 for their next triumph when they won the competition again. United's win rate of 45 per cent in all competitions this season is their lowest since 1989-90. Since former manager Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, United have lifted just three pieces of silverware. The FA Cup under Louis van Gaal in 2016, and the League Cup and Europa League under Jose Mourinho the following year. After the high-profile arrivals of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho last summer, United were expected to mount a serious challenge for trophies this season, but they quickly fell behind rivals Manchester City and Liverpool in the Premier League and now face an uphill struggle to finish in the top four. In a campaign that has seen former player Ole Gunnar Solskjaer lose his job as manager and Ralf Rangnick become interim boss, United crashed out of both domestic cup competitions with home losses to West Ham in September and Middlesbrough last month. Man Utd fixtures Champions League Find out more about Sky Sports Get Sky Sports Their remaining hope was the Champions League, but defeat by Atletico Madrid in the last 16 sees their trophy drought extend into a sixth consecutive season. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports' Dan Sansom: May 24, 2017. The last time Manchester United won a major trophy. April 22, 2013. The last time Manchester United won the Premier League. Under Sir Alex Ferguson, United never went more than three seasons without winning the Premier League title. For those who grew up knowing nothing else but endless success under the Scot, it is understandable to view the current run of nine years following his retirement as a catastrophe. But for a club and institution the size of United, that's exactly what it is. Since his departure, United have lifted just three major trophies in nine seasons. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was tasked with restoring United to former glories when he replaced Jose Mourinho in 2018, but a mammoth penalty shootout loss to Villarreal in last season's Europa League final was the closest he came before eventually being sacked later that year. Attention then turned to interim boss Ralf Rangnick, but a shock FA Cup defeat by Middlesbrough ended United's best chance of winning silverware in what has been - to put it mildly - a disastrous 2021/22 campaign. It is now half a decade since United last won a major trophy - their longest drought in 40 years. Liverpool waited 30 years for a top-flight title. It will already be 10 if United fall short in the league next season and although it might be a stretch to suggest they are on the same path, history has a strange way of repeating itself. On current evidence, United's barren streak looks set to continue for a while yet. How have Manchester United performed since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013?

United held official talks with the 52-year-old last week which were billed as ""very positive"", and Sky Sports News understands that a process of due diligence has followed over what it would entail should they choose to hire him. Ajax granted permission for the formal discussion to take place and have not been obstructive to the process. Sources close to Ten Hag and the Dutch club have suggested that dialogue has taken place over the financial element as well as how to handle a possible announcement - should the process progress that way - in terms of timing and presentation, given Ajax are in a tight title race. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player However, United insist this is premature, and no formal enquiry has been put forward in that regard. They have made it very clear that they do not have a preferred candidate yet to take charge next season, and are simply following a rigorous process to settle on the right man. Ascertaining compensation figures and ease of appointment will be done with all candidates. The club feels it is unfair to portray Ten Hag as the frontrunner for the position when they are still working through their shortlist. Mauricio Pochettino and Luis Enrique are also under consideration, while Julen Lopetegui seemingly ruled himself out of contention by saying: ""I am where I want to be. Continue on the Sevilla bench next season? I have no doubt.""

Paris Saint-Germain, meanwhile, will part company with Pochettino on their terms and not that of another club. It has been reported they would have to fork out between £15m to £20m if they sack the Argentine and his staff, an outlay that would be saved if he was offered and accepted another job. Pochettino and Ten Hag have long been considered the favoured options for the job, a line of reporting that hasn't been discouraged by United. Interest in Enrique is complicated by his commitment to Spain, who he is due to lead at the World Cup in Qatar.

Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: ""The early kick-off is the last game you really want after an international break. Jurgen Klopp has had players all over the world in the last week so we'll have to wait until Friday to get the medical report from the Liverpool boss. ""The south American contingent were still in action in the early hours of Wednesday morning, while Mo Salah and Sadio Mane played against each other for 120 minutes in an extremely tight game that went to penalties on Tuesday. ""There's also the issue at right-back and he has a decision to make as to who will fill in for the injured Trent Alexander-Arnold. ""So, Klopp will have to juggle his resources once again and while most people will have this as a home banker for Liverpool, who are on this incredible run at the moment and looking for a 10th straight league win, I think it will be a harder game for them than many people think. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player ""The international break will have given Roy Hodgson more time to work with his players on the training pitch and you can see Watford being even more defensively well drilled ahead of the trip to Anfield. Premier League table Live football on Sky Sports Get Sky Sports Get NOW to stream big moments ""It has to be a full-strength team for Liverpool, despite their busy schedule coming up. It's a simple formula for the Reds. They have to win every single game now, and that has been the same since January when they were 14 points behind. ""Can they keep it up? I think Liverpool can win the next nine games, absolutely. There is obviously the Man City game at the Etihad, which I'm sure, right now, Liverpool would take a point. Many people say they have to win that game, but I don't believe they do. ""A draw at City and eight wins, starting against Watford on Saturday, I think that would be enough to win the title."" Sky Sports' Joe Shread: ""I can't imagine it'd be a huge issue for a team as good and as big as Manchester City if Ruben Dias and John Stones were missing for the trip to Turf Moor. ""They have depth in their squad in Aymeric Laporte and Nathan Ake. Fernandinho has also done well as a centre back before. ""If you were talking about this being the situation ahead of that Liverpool game in just over a week's time then maybe you'd be a bit concerned, but with all due respect to Burnley, City should be able to cope this weekend even with a bit of a make-shift pairing at the back. ""Burnley have got a terrible record against City. They have lost their last nine in all competitions against City. Burnley haven't beaten Pep Guardiola's side since 2015. They haven't won in 14 games with 13 of those coming as defeats. The aggregate score in the last nine games between the two sides is 32-1 in favour of City. ""So, as much as Guardiola won't just be chalking this one up as a win, it's going to be a big shock if Burnley get anything out of this game, regardless of who plays at centre-back for City."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Joe Shread: ""I'm not so sure it will have much effect on the players. ""We've got to remember that it wasn't so long ago that all these Premier League games were being played in front of empty stadiums because of the pandemic. ""The players are very used to playing with no fans at all in the ground let alone 50 per cent full or 75 per cent full, whatever it is going to be at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. ""I think Chelsea, the team, deserve plenty of credit for what they have done since Roman Abramovich announced he was selling the club. They have won six in a row in all competitions. ""Thomas Tuchel seems to have done a very good job of keeping the team focused on matters on the field, especially when they are in a strange situation in the Premier League. They look too far ahead of the chasing pack to slip out of the top four, but they are too far behind Liverpool and Man City to challenge for the title. ""It's just a case of keeping the wins ticking over to make sure you sow up third and then you can really go for it in the Champions League and the FA Cup, and that, to be fair, is exactly what they have been doing since all the chaos off the field started. ""So, all in all, I don't think it is going to be a huge issue, regardless of how many fans are going to be in the stadium on Saturday."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: ""Leeds have opponents, on paper, that you'd like to play at the moment in out-of-form Southampton. ""I think this is going to be an intriguing game. Leeds have the momentum of those two incredible late wins against Norwich and then that bonkers game against Wolves. ""You just wonder whether those two games have given Leeds the momentum they need to stay out of the relegation battle. They have moved seven points clear now of the drop zone and that is quite a cushion from the likes of Burnley. ""Another win here against Southampton and I think that is almost enough for Leeds. So, that is a huge incentive for Jesse Marsch's side when Saints visit Elland Road. ""Although die-hard Leeds fans would be ever loathe to admit this because of the work Marcelo Bielsa did for Leeds, the change in manager might have come just at the right time for Leeds because it's clear to see the impact Marsch has made already. ""He seems a very likeable coach and it looks to be a very good appointment for Leeds.""

""It's similar to Liverpool's situation and their chase for the title. They near enough have to win every game and that is the same for United in the race for the top-four. ""At this stage of the season you just can't afford to slip up. There is no margin for error, especially at home against a mid-table side, which Leicester are this season. However, the Foxes do have a decent recent record against United, winning their last three games in all competitions against them. ""So, it is absolutely must-win for United. They have never lost four games in a row in all competitions against Leicester in their entire history and this weekend isn't really the time to be setting that record if United are serious about their top-four challenge."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: ""There's been a huge creative void at Everton this season. They have really struggled to score. ""It's been painful at times, but there have been reasons for it. ""Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who was the club's top scorer last season, has barely featured all season and he only has three league goals to his name in this campaign. Richarlison has also had injury struggles and although he scored three times in two matches for Brazil last week, he hasn't really had the same impact for Everton. ""Richarlison is the one for me, however. Everton need to get him the ball more. ""There are no real surprises to see his name in the papers again, linking him with a number of big-name teams again this summer, and it wouldn't surprise me to see him leave the club in the next transfer window. ""But before that Everton need him and he is the player that can provide the spark Frank Lampard's side have been missing. He has been one of their better players in recent weeks and will be crucial if Everton are to beat the drop. ""Everton's bigger issue is in midfield. How are they going to get the ball to Richarlison? How are they going to create chances? Abdoulaye Doucoure and Allan are their mainstays in the middle, but it is out wide where I have my concerns. ""I think it is going to be a very hard game for Everton, especially against David Moyes' West Ham, who are still in the hunt for Europe."" Sky Sports'Joe Shread: ""The job Eddie Howe has done at Newcastle is very impressive. You do caveat that with the amount of money he was able to spend in January. ""I know Kieran Trippier has been out injured for a lot of the time, but he did have an immediate impact when he first came in. Dan Burn looks good, and he has helped shore up that defence. ""So, he was able to spend money that other managers at the bottom end of the table weren't, including former Newcastle boss Steve Bruce. ""However, he has taken a lot of players that either were not in Bruce's plans or who were not playing well under Bruce, and he has turned them into key players. For example, Fabian Schar looks good at the back. Joelinton and Ryan Fraser looked to be bit-part players under Bruce but they are performing well now. ""So, Howe has done a really impressive job on the field and that defensive record is really impressive. They have only conceded eight goals in their last 11 games. They have lost very few games since Christmas and he has achieved the number one target, which was staying up. ""It will now be interesting to see how they do against Spurs where they will come up against Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son, who have looked terrific recently. It will be interesting to see whether this new-look Newcastle defence can deal with the threat of Kane and Son."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: ""The results that Man Utd and Spurs get against Leicester and Newcastle respectively will determine how much pressure will be cranked up on Arsenal when they travel to Crystal Palace on Monday Night Football. ""On paper, you'd probably expect two wins for United and Spurs as they both look to keep the pressure on in the race for the top-four, and in which case, there would be huge pressure on Arsenal because United and Spurs would be right on their coat tails. ""However, it would be no more pressure than they faced just before the international break when they went to Aston Villa and ground out a win just after losing to Liverpool. ""A lot of people were questioning how Arsenal would respond and that was a tricky looking assignment at Villa Park against an in-form Aston Villa team, and I think the game at Palace will be an equally tough test of their top-four credentials. ""It's a London derby, Selhurst Park under the lights and there will be a cracking atmosphere. I can see this being a huge test for the Gunners."" Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: ""It's a big weekend for Arsenal and Mikel Arteta. The pressure could really be on by the time they get to face Palace on Monday. This is going to be a tough game for Arsenal. There is obviously plenty to gain for Arsenal, but there is also plenty to lose, especially if the pressure is cracked up by wins for Spurs and United. You do just wonder that if this young Arsenal side start to drop a few points, could the wheels come off."" Sky Sports' Joe Shread: ""It's a huge few days for Everton, and in particular, Frank Lampard. Lampard is going back to West Ham, and he is not well liked there after he left the club to join rivals Chelsea. This could be a tasty affair. Lampard has only managed once at the London Stadium and that was as Chelsea boss when his side lost 3-2, but that was in front of an empty stadium. ""Obviously, the bigger picture for Everton is that they need as many points as they can get in this relegation battle, and this game could be a big opportunity for them. I know they are away from home against a very good West Ham side, but this is a weekend where Watford play Liverpool and Burnley play Man City. So, you'd expect those two sides to struggle and that could leave the door open for Everton, who could go six points clear of the drop zone with a win."" Sky Sports' Ron Walker: ""I'm going for Manchester United. The ball is not in their court in terms of getting into the top-four, so they need to be faultless with Leicester, Everton and Norwich in their next three games. That then takes them into a double header with Arsenal and Liverpool, but they could be out of the race altogether if they slip up against team they really should be beating. It's not the defeats that are going to cause them problems, it is the draws. They draw far too many games and any more and it will be curtains for their Champions League hopes."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: ""I've gone for something a bit unoriginal, but there have been mutterings that league leaders and champions Manchester City are about to be caught by Liverpool. I think plenty of people are playing City down. ""There are also mutterings that they might slip up at Burnely. It's a hard game and they have defensive worries, but I think they are going to slap down those concerns with a resounding 5-0 win just to quieten down those people who are questioning their title credentials."" Sky Sports' Joe Shread: ""I was looking for an upset and I am going for Crystal Palace and Gunners legend Patrick Vieira derailing Arsenal's top-four bid. Palace's FA Cup win over Everton was really impressive. I was really impressed with Palace, and they are now unbeaten in over a month, holding Man City to a 0-0 draw on MNF earlier this month. Arsenal have been good against the sides they should beat, and this is a game they should really win, but this one does look a tough proposition, and Vieira will be looking to impress against the club that helped to make him in English football."" Sky Sports' Ron Walker: ""My prediction is Newcastle to get something at Tottenham. The job Eddie Howe has done since going in at Newcastle has been fantastic. He's shored them up which a lot of people thought he couldn't do and also, you just don't know which Spurs will turn up.""

Since the Aaron Ramsdale, Ben White and Gabriel axis was formed four games into the season, Arsenal have scored 14 first-half goals in their last 11 away Premier League matches. Only Liverpool have scored more - and that's despite the Gunners playing two games less than the majority of their rivals. Mikel Arteta instructs his team to play aggressively from the off and that is seen by 11 of their 14 first-half goals away from home coming before the 30th minute. That is the most scored in that period when assessing away games, along with Liverpool. Arsenal have won their last five Premier League away games, scoring 14 goals and have led at the break in their last six - the only blip being the second-half collapse at Everton. Palace are a tough nut to crack at home, but do have a tendency of starting very slowly in matches. They have failed to score in the first half of 10 of their 15 home matches, including against Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham and Chelsea. All of this adds up to Arsenal being in front at the break at 13/8 with Sky Bet looking like a solid play. Watch Premier League highlights Bet with Sky Bet Whether they can hold on and remain in pole position to finish in a Champions League place will be all about their ability to see the game out in the second period.

The interview was part of the ongoing process to appoint the next permanent first-team boss. That process is said to have now reached a more advanced stage, but does not mean Ten Hag has emerged as the club's first choice. As part of the process, United also plan to speak to their other preferred candidates. According to United sources, there is no early favourite yet and they are open-minded about the identity of their new manager. Sky Sports News reported earlier this week the other candidates are Mauricio Pochettino, Julen Lopetegui and Luis Enrique. Ten Hag has a contract at Ajax that runs until the summer of 2023, but United's good relationship with the Dutch club - former goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar is chief executive - allowed them to speak to him. Rangnick role not clear | Ten Hag, Poch lead shortlist Man Utd fixtures Live football on Sky Sports this week How to watch Premier League highlights The club want to make a decision on their next permanent manager as soon as possible. However, they have not put a formal deadline on the process, which is being led by Darren Fletcher and John Murtough. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Ajax have declined to comment, while Ten Hag's representatives have been contacted for comment. United had previously distanced themselves from coverage suggesting they are circling around Thomas Tuchel amid Chelsea's uncertain future with one source describing it as ""media talk not reality"". They maintained there is a four-man shortlist being considered to take charge of the club, which does not feature the reigning European Cup-winning manager. United are aware the opening move for a new ownership group at Stamford Bridge will be to secure Tuchel's future. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The 48-year-old has also displayed the absolute opposite of a desire to exit Chelsea, navigating difficult circumstances with aplomb and underlining his happiness despite the upheaval. United want a manager in place ahead of the new season. Sky Sports News' senior reporter Melissa Reddy: Erik ten Hag having a formal interview with Manchester United will come as no surprise given his status as one of the most progressive coaches in Europe, and his long links to their managerial vacancy. The 52-year-old has had admirers at Old Trafford stretching back to 2018/19, when his Ajax side knocked out Real Madrid in the Champions League last 16, before then stunning Juventus and only being denied a place in the final after Lucas Moura's last-minute goal for Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham. Ten Hag is a popular choice to take charge at Old Trafford and represents what is seen as a ""fresh, exciting future"", although there is an acceptance risk is involved as it would be a sizeable leap for him. The expectations, global glare placed on United, and level of competition at the top end of the Premier League is like nothing he would have previously experienced. Ten Hag was interviewed by Spurs as a possible replacement for Jose Mourinho last summer, but they passed on the opportunity citing a lack of ""charisma"". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The last highly successful Ajax coach to move to England's top flight - via Inter - was Frank de Boer, who lasted just 77 days at Crystal Palace. Being granted an audience with Ten Hag was made easy by United's smooth relationship with the Dutch club. Speaking to Pochettino, the other strong candidate, would not be as simple with Paris Saint-Germain not as obliging. United's insistence that there is ""no early favourite"" for the role, and that they are remaining open-minded, will not water down the feeling that Ten Hag is their man given the public nature of this development. Both he and Pochettino are under contract at their clubs until June 2023, so compensation would be involved. Julen Lopetegui and Luis Enrique are the other two men on the shortlist and the club state their desire is to follow the process with all candidates. United are eager to avoid the errors that have led to them searching for a fifth permanent manager in nine years. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Dutch football expert Marcel van der Kraan: ""There are three major opportunities for Erik ten Hag. Manchester United is only one of them. I don't want to dampen the excitement in England but maybe United have not done all the work yet. ""Yes, they've had positive talks with Ten Hag but so have two other major clubs in Europe. These are clubs who play Champions League football and who have chances to win titles in their own country. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  ""One of those clubs is very concrete for Ten Hag, and I think that is on mainland Europe - not in England. I know for a fact that Ten Hag is very excited about that job too. ""If Manchester United want to get things going, they will have to speed things up and make things concrete. They will have to put a contract out to him because I think there's a real danger it could become too late for him. ""For Ten Hag, there may be the consideration of the graveyard Manchester United has been for managers. ""Not everything during his career has gone well for United when you see how Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have all failed and seen their reputations damaged.

As hosts, Qatar receive automatic qualification to next year's tournament, which consists of 32 teams in eight groups of four and will be held between November 21 and December 18. Four-time World Cup winners Germany were the first team to guarantee a spot through the qualification process in October as UEFA Group J winners, with Denmark booking their place a day later. In November, Brazil - the most successful national team in World Cup history with five trophies - became the fourth team to secure qualification as one of the top four teams in South America's groups. Saudi Arabia and Japan have also been confirmed in Qatar after the Samurai Blue beat Australia 2-0 on March 24. European champions Italy missed out on the World Cup for a second consecutive tournament after a shock 1-0 stoppage-time defeat to North Macedonia in their play-off semi-final. Uruguay and Ecuador secured their spots at the World Cup finals, joining Brazil and Argentina as the automatic qualifiers from the South American group. Peru also clinched the play-off spot thanks to their 2-0 win against Paraguay in the final qualification game. Canada qualified for the World Cup finals for just the second time, beating Jamaica 4-0 to book their ticket to Qatar and end 36 years of failure and heartache. Mexico and the United States also qualified for the World Cup in their final qualifier, while Costa Rica will face New Zealand in a play-off in June for a spot in Qatar. On Tuesday, Senegal, Ghana, Morocco, Cameroon and Tunisia booked their places at Qatar 2022. Sadio Mane scored the winning kick as Senegal beat Egypt 3-1 on penalties, with Mo Salah among the Egyptian players to miss their spot-kicks. In Europe, Portugal and Poland progressed to the finals after winning their play-off finals against North Macedonia and Sweden respectively. The third and final European play-off, which will feature Wales against Scotland or Ukraine, has been delayed until June. By the end of March, we will know 28 of the 32 participants at the first winter World Cup. The final three places will be decided in the intercontinental play-offs in June as well as the final European play-off final which has been delayed due to the Ukraine-Russia crisis. The draw for the tournament takes place on Friday 1 April 2022, at the DECC venue in Doha, Qatar at circa 5pm GMT. The 2022 World Cup in Qatar will feature 32 teams in eight groups of four. Four matches will be played each day during the group stage, which will run over a 12-day period and see winners and runners-up progress to the round of 16. Matches will only be assigned to particular venues after the finals draw, so organisers can choose optimal kick-off times to suit television audiences in different countries, as well as supporters in Qatar. The finals draw is scheduled to take place in April 2022, after the March window for international fixtures. Unlike at Euro 2020, there will be a third-place play-off game on December 17.

There's still plenty of time for players to make their case with England's Nations League campaign starting this summer, while there will be more friendlies arranged for the Three Lions in the build-up to the World Cup, which starts in November. So, who will make Southgate's squad? The Sky Sports football writers have had their say! Read on to see who they've chosen and why, then use our team selector to pick YOUR England squad for Qatar... Goalkeepers: Jordan Pickford, Aaron Ramsdale, Nick Pope    Defenders: Trent Alexander-Arnold, Reece James, Kyle Walker, Harry Maguire, John Stones, Ben Chilwell, Benjamin White, Kieran Trippier   Midfielders: Declan Rice, Kalvin Phillips, Jordan Henderson, Jude Bellingham, Mason Mount.    Forwards: Bukayo Saka, Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden, Tammy Abraham, Jack Grealish, Jadon Sancho. Sky Sports' Peter Smith: An in-season World Cup means form could be decisive - and makes selecting a squad eight months early hard to do! But England's strongest XI overall right now - for me: Pickford, Alexander-Arnold, Walker, Maguire, Stones, Chilwell, Rice, Phillips, Saka, Kane, Sterling - will need to be supplemented by players who can add flexibility or x-factor. Ben White (defence or midfield), Kieran Trippier (full-back/wing-back on either side with bonus set-piece skills), and Jadon Sancho (just edging out Jarrod Bowen) make the cut, with a reliance on potential emergency alternatives at centre-back (Reece James, Declan Rice, Kalvin Phillips) allowing me to add an extra attacker. England fixtures Download the Sky Sports App Live football on Sky Sports this week Find out more about Sky Sports Jordan Henderson may not get many minutes but is an important leader in the group, while Jude Bellingham already belongs at this level, Tammy Abraham is back to being Harry Kane's understudy, and Man City pals Phil Foden and Jack Grealish can unlock doors in tight games. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Goalkeepers: Jordan Pickford, Aaron Ramsdale, Nick Pope   Defenders: Trent Alexander-Arnold, Reece James, John Stones, Harry Maguire, Ben White, Tyrone Mings, Luke Shaw, Ben Chilwell   Midfielders: Declan Rice, Jordan Henderson, Jude Bellingham, Mason Mount, Phil Foden, Emile Smith Rowe.   Forwards: Bukayo Saka, Harry Kane, Jadon Sancho, Jack Grealish, Raheem Sterling, Ollie Watkins. Sky Sports' Sam Blitz: This is perhaps one of the easier England squads to predict out of the last few major tournaments. Southgate will ideally want to keep a large bulk of the Euro 2020 squad for team harmony purposes, so expect only a few changes from last summer's crop of heroes. One surprise call should be Ollie Watkins, who should soar to new heights under Steven Gerrard at Aston Villa next season and scored in the 3-0 friendly victory over Ivory Coast. The Villa man is the closest striker England have to Kane in terms of style and Southgate's faith in Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Marcus Rashford is reducing as the months go by. Should he be fit and return to his pre-injury form, Ben Chilwell should retain his place but expect one of Kieran Trippier, Aaron Cresswell or Rico Henry to step up if he falls short. Meanwhile, Ben White's form for Arsenal should put him ahead of Conor Coady at centre-half. Goalkeepers: Jordan Pickford, Aaron Ramsdale, Nick Pope.   Defenders: Trent Alexander-Arnold, Reece James, Ben Chilwell, Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire, John Stones, Conor Coady, Ben White.   Midfielders: Declan Rice, Kalvin Phillips, Mason Mount, Phil Foden, Jude Bellingham, Emile Smith Rowe, Conor Gallagher.   Forwards: Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, Jack Grealish, Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford. Sky Sports' Nick Wright: There has been a rush to write off Marcus Rashford recently but I'm confident he will rediscover his form before the tournament - be that at Manchester United or somewhere else. He's a world-class talent with a good England record and still only 24. I think Emile Smith Rowe is worthy of inclusion too. He is relatively inexperienced but he always affects games. Just look at how he continued scoring during his recent spell as a substitute at Arsenal. He could be a difference-maker from the bench. Conor Gallagher is similarly inexperienced at senior level but his extraordinary engine would be invaluable in what is likely to be a gruelling schedule in Qatar. I'd take him over Jordan Henderson, especially with Declan Rice now filling the leadership void. Goalkeepers: Jordan Pickford, Aaron Ramsdale, Nick Pope   Defenders: Trent Alexander-Arnold, Reece James, Kyle Walker-Peters, Luke Shaw, John Stones, Conor Coady, Harry Maguire, Benjamin White.   Midfielders: Declan Rice, Kalvin Phillips, James Ward-Prowse, Jude Bellingham, Conor Gallagher, Mason Mount, Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka   Forwards: Jack Grealish, Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane, Tammy Abraham. Sky Sports' Laura Hunter: Tournament experience is important, but with such an abundance of young talent at his disposal, it's time for Gareth Southgate to take a chance on some periphery players. Undoubtedly, last summer's heroics will be all too fresh in the mind of the England manager - and rightly so. But, embracing a change in personnel will add to squad depth, not detract. James Ward-Prowse is enjoying a fine season for Southampton. Given the Three Lions' central midfield options, the Saints captain is often overlooked, but his set-piece prowess and general reliability should be given careful consideration. He is a leader for club, which is important if the squad generally possesses less big tournament knowhow. Versatility should also be a characteristic held in high regard if England want to go the distance in Qatar; Kyle Walker-Peters is the perfect replacement for Kieran Trippier given his ability on both flanks. Tammy Abraham should deputise for Harry Kane, if his Serie A form continues, while Conor Gallagher would also be a breath of fresh air. Goalkeepers: Jordan Pickford, Aaron Ramsdale, Nick Pope.   Defenders: Reece James, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Luke Shaw, Ben Chilwell, John Stones, Harry Maguire, Conor Coady, Benjamin White.   Midfielders: Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham, Kalvin Phillips, Conor Gallagher, Mason Mount.   Forwards: Harry Kane, Tammy Abraham, Bukayo Saka, Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Jadon Sancho. Sky Sports' Oliver Yew: There is competition for places all over this England squad, and that is shown in the quality of player that could miss out on the Three Lions' World Cup in Qatar. It's starting to look increasingly difficult for Marcus Rashford, who has slipped out of Gareth Southgate's squad. Meanwhile, Jordan Henderson, Kyle Walker and Kieran Tripper, who were all key members of England's Euro 2020 squad, could also miss the cut with the emergence of Conor Gallagher and the form of Reece James and Trent Alexander-Arnold for Chelsea and Liverpool respectively. Interesting inclusions include striker Tammy Abraham, who has been in fine form since leaving Chelsea for Roma. He has scored 23 goals since his switch to the Italian capital and should he stay performing at that level it would be difficult to ignore him as the back-up option to Harry Kane. Meanwhile, Gallagher's impressive rise with Crystal Palace has seen him become a regular member of recent squads. His quality on the ball and his energy makes him a really interesting pick and it could be at the expense of Henderson, who is one of England's more experienced players. It will be interesting to see where his future lies next season and whether he will get enough game-time to stay in Southgate's plans. There are plenty of problems for Southgate to solve in the coming months. Goalkeepers: JordanPickford, Aaron Ramsdale, Nick Pope   Defenders: KyleWalker, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Harry Maguire, John Stones, Conor Coady, Tyrone Mings, Ben Chilwell, Luke Shaw   Midfielders: DeclanRice, Kalvin Phillips, Jude Bellingham, Jordan Henderson, Mason Mount, Phil Foden   Forwards: JackGrealish, Raheem Sterling, Bukayo Saka, Harry Kane, Tammy Abraham, Jadon Sancho Sky Sports' Ron Walker: I can't remember a time where picking an England squad has been quite this tricky. The goalkeepers do pick themselves at least, and so does most of the defence. Trent Alexander-Arnold wins out over Reece James and Conor Coady is a good dressing room voice and well equipped when we play a back three. The temptation of including the overlooked outsider is always there but Gareth Southgate's loyalty to his trusted players has taken us to back-to-back semi-finals and given Tyrone Mings' club form, plus his aerial presence, he goes over Fikayo Tomori. Just. Kalvin Phillips' injury troubles are a concern but he's still got seven months to get fit and has to go after his performances at Euro 2020. I'd love to squeeze Connor Gallagher in there, but his time will come and England just have slightly too many good options with more international experience. Tammy Abraham because if England need a goal, he's a better option off the bench than Ollie Watkins in my view, although Dominic Calvert-Lewin could usurp him by November. Jadon Sancho's still yet to really show it on the international stage, but the promising Jarrod Bowen got injured at just the wrong point and is, sadly, running out of time to integrate himself into the squad. Goalkeepers:Jordan Pickford, Aaron Ramsdale, Nick Pope   Defenders:Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ben Chilwell, Reece James, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, John Stones, Fikayo Tomori, Kyle Walker.   Midfielders:Jude Bellingham, Conor Gallagher, Jordan Henderson, Mason Mount, Kalvin Phillips, Declan Rice.   Forwards:Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Harry Kane, Bukayo Saka, Jadon Sancho, Raheem Sterling. Sky Sports' Jack Wilkinson: With squads reduced from 26 to 23 players for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Gareth Southgate is going to have to make some tough decisions over players who have been crucial in England's recent upsurge. But there can be no room for sentiment if the Three Lions are going to realise an objective 56 years in the making. Tyrone Mings and Conor Coady, regulars in Southgate's squads, regrettably do not make the cut on this occasion. Mings should be nowhere near the England set-up on current form, while the luxury of selecting Coady - who, let's face it, isn't going to break into the first XI - purely because he's good for morale in the camp, cannot be accommodated with the revised squad sizes. Selecting players who are not only going to feature but will elevate performance levels on the pitch is going to be crucial, that's where Fikayo Tomori comes in. His stellar campaign at Serie A leaders AC Milan should have been recognised with a call-up for England's friendly double-header in March, but Southgate will be unable to ignore him any longer if he goes on to guide the Rossoneri to the Scudetto. The personality and maturity Conor Gallagher has displayed in his seamless transition to international football, coupled with his burgeoning club form, make him an ideal addition to a now-familiar England midfield group which, along with the goalkeepers, virtually picks itself. Things become rather difficult in attack, though. Yes, Kane, Foden, Sterling, Saka and Grealish are shoo-ins to be on the plane, but who should join them? It all depends on what Southgate regards as his Plan B if a Kane-focused Plan A proves fruitless. Jadon Sancho could be the answer if a false-nine system is viewed as an alternative. If a like-for-like back-up striker is required, Marcus Rashford looks a better option, providing he manages to find an ounce of form before Qatar. Goalkeepers:Jordan Pickford, Nick Pope, Aaron Ramsdale.   Defenders: Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ben Chilwell, Conor Coady, Reece James, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, John Stones, Kyle Walker, Ben White.   Midfielders:Jude Bellingham, Jack Grealish, Jordan Henderson, Mason Mount, Kalvin Phillips, Declan Rice.   Forwards:Tammy Abraham, Phil Foden, Harry Kane, Bukayo Saka, Raheem Sterling. Sky Sports' Declan Olley: Jadon Sancho was the one who just missed out for me, but would be my first replacement if any of the wide forward options were injured or badly out of form. With temperatures potentially reaching as high as 30 degrees Celsius in Qatar, I have gone with four central midfielders, including Kalvin Phillips. Despite his current injury problems, I am confident the Leeds midfielder will rediscover that Euro 2020 form next season. And defensively, Kyle Walker's versatility as both a right-back and centre-halve in a back three helps with his inclusion, while Conor Coady gets the nod as the fourth-choice centre-back ahead of Tyrone Mings.

Don't expect many surprise selections in here. Kyle Walker's pace is a crucial asset at international level to prevent counter-attacks while Kieran Trippier's know-how and versality puts him in ahead of Ben Chilwell. Tyrone Mings gets the nod over Conor Coady based on his solid performances at Euro 2020. The same applies to the injury-stricken Kalvin Phillips, who will be on the plane instead of James Ward-Prowse although form and fitness will dictate this decision in eight months' time. The biggest omission is Marcus Rashford, who loses out to Jadon Sancho, as does Jarrod Bowen. Tammy Abraham is the only outfield player to have not represented England at a major tournament, but his current form has to put him in ahead of Ollie Watkins and Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Goalkeepers:Jordan Pickford, Aaron Ramsdale, Sam Johnstone     Defenders:Kyle Walker, Reece James, Harry Maguire, John Stones, Fikayo Tomori, Ben White, Ben Chilwell, Luke Shaw.    Midfielders:Declan Rice, Kalvin Phillips, Jordan Henderson, Jude Bellingham, Mason Mount.     Forwards:Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho. Sky Sports' Zinny Boswell: Leaving Trent Alexander-Arnold and Kieran Trippier out may seem like a harsh call - and it probably is - but I couldn't look any further than Kyle Walker or Reece James at right back. Walker would be my first-choice right back and one of the three centre backs in a back five. As the back-up option would largely be playing wing back, James felt like the obvious choice given his experience and output featuring in that position for Chelsea. Marcus Rashford is more of a hopeful inclusion, as his performances have been poor for the past 12 months. But with the promise of a fresh start at Manchester United under a new manager and eight months until the World Cup, I feel confident he can rediscover his best form by then. His versatility - being able to play back up to Harry Kane and as a wide forward - puts him narrowly ahead of Tammy Abraham in my thinking. Fikayo Tomori has largely been overlooked by Southgate since moving to AC Milan, but the former Chelsea centre-back is proving he has the quality to figure in England's World Cup squad. Goalkeepers:Jordan Pickford, Aaron Ramsdale, Nick Pope     Defenders:Harry Maguire, John Stones, Conor Coady, Ben White, Ben Chilwell, Luke Shaw, Kyle Walker, Reece James, Trent Alexander-Arnold.    Midfielders:Declan Rice, Kalvin Phillips, Jordan Henderson, Mason Mount, Phil Foden   Forwards:Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, Jack Grealish, Bukayo Saka, Jadon Sancho, Dominic Calvert-Lewin Sky Sports' Adam Smith: I would expect John Stones and Harry Maguire to make the starting XI in Qatar, but Conor Coady is reliable and vocal and can play in a three, while Ben White offers the versatility often required at tournaments. In terms of the full-backs, there could be an argument to omit Trent Alexander-Arnold based on Southgate preferring Reece James and Kyle Walker - but his world-class distribution could be a game-changer. In midfield, Jude Bellingham becomes my notable casualty, while Conor Gallagher and James Ward-Prowse also deserve tickets. Of those, Gallagher would be my back-up, based on his combination of form, influence, energy levels, defensive work and attacking output. A raft of forwards vie for positions up top, but the prime candidates are almost certainly guaranteed spots. However, the seat for Harry Kane's understudy is up for grabs and Dominic Calvert-Lewin is my choice as an additional, emergency aerial option.

Defenders: Kyle Walker, Reece James, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ben Chilwell, Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire, John Stones, Conor Coady.    Midfielders :Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham, Jordan Henderson, Kalvin Phillips, Mason Mount, James Ward-Prowse, Phil Foden.    Forwards: Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, Jadon Sancho, Bukayo Saka, Jack Grealish. Sky Sports' Ben Grounds: Gareth Southgate has highlighted England's lack of penalty experience, revealing the squad have already begun practising for a potential shoot-out. After the European Championship final defeat on penalties to Italy at Wembley, Southgate was convinced experience played a part - an assessment backed up by his side's statistics. Fine margins decided last summer's tournament and will do so again in Qatar. James Ward-Prowse is one of only two regular penalty-takers for their club along with Harry Kane and must therefore be included. Marcus Rashford's form has fallen off a cliff while he has even dropped down the pecking order when it comes to spot-kicks at Manchester United, where Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes share the responsibility. Raheem Sterling has a poor record with six successful efforts out of 12 while Jack Grealish was one of those criticised for not stepping up against Italy having not taken a senior penalty in regulation. Conversely, Ward-Prowse has scored 12 out of 16 (75 per cent) for Southampton. Such a minor detail when addressing the make-up of this England squad cannot be overlooked. Two camps and six games remaining doesn't afford Southgate much time to experiment with options outside of what he already knows. With that in mind, don't expect too many other surprises. Goalkeepers:Jordan Pickford, Aaron Ramsdale, Nick Pope.    Defenders:Reece James, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ben Chilwell, Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire, John Stones, Fikayo Tomori, Ben White.    Midfielders:Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham, Jordan Henderson, Kalvin Phillips, Mason Mount, Phil Foden.    Forwards: Harry Kane, Tammy Abraham, Raheem Sterling, Jadon Sancho, Bukayo Saka, Jack Grealish. Sky Sports' Joe Shread: There's no debate over the three goalkeepers, so the conversation begins in defence. Reece James is the number one right-back and can also play in a back three, while the nonsense over Trent Alexander-Arnold's potential absence needs stamping out - he's a unique attacking weapon and deserves his place ahead of Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier. Fikayo Tomori is another who's been wrongly overlooked but gets a long-overdue call up here, while Ben White edges out Conor Coady and Tyrone Mings. In midfield, Conor Gallagher and James Ward-Prowse are unlucky to miss out, but there's plenty of steel and flair among the midfielders in this squad. There's no place for Marcus Rashford among the forwards, although Jack Grealish - who has a lot more to do to convince me he's worthy of the hype - would find himself under pressure if the Manchester United man rediscovers his form. Tammy Abraham's impressive performances for Roma earn him the job as Harry Kane's back up.

To be decided: Oceania had not been able to hold national-team competitions since late 2019 due to the impact of Covid-19. Due to lingering travel and quarantine restrictions, March 2022 presented the first - and indeed last - opportunity for the preliminary competition to take place. The format, dates and draw procedures for the OFC preliminary competition for the FIFA World Cup 2022 have been revised. FIFA changed the format after the Cook Islands and Vanuatu withdrew due to cases of COVID-19 that affected their national teams. Both the Cook Islands and Vanuatu were in Group A but FIFA said all matches involving the two teams ""shall be deemed to have not taken place"". That left the other two teams in the group, Solomon Islands and Tahiti, to play their group fixture, which was considered a single play-off match to determine the winner and runner-up of Group A. Solomon Islands won 2-1. They then faced New Zealand for the intercontinental play-off spot, with the All Whites winning 5-0. They will now face Costa Rica in June for a spot at the 2022 World Cup.
